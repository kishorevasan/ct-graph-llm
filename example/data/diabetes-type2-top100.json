We will do this by comparing the effect of the study drug with placebo (no drug present) and against a drug (sitagliptin) known to control blood glucose in the treatment of diabetes.\n\nThe purpose of Part B of this study is to determine the how the timing of dosing, relative to meals, affects the response to study drug.","detailedDescription":"Part A is a double-blind, randomized, parallel group, dose-ranging study, in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus to assess safety, tolerability, and to estimate the pharmacodynamic effects when subjects receive repeated doses of placebo, sitagliptin (Januvia), or GSK1614235. The target is to explore the best doses of GSK1614235 that provide glucose control with minimal adverse effects.\n\nThere will be at least 4 cohorts of subjects:\n\n* Cohort 1: 8 subjects randomized to receive placebo, 100mg sitagliptin QD, or 1mg GSK1612435 BID\n* Cohort 2: 6 subjects randomized to receive placebo, 100mg sitagliptin QD, or 5mg GSK1612435 BID.\n* Cohort 3: 6 subjects randomized to receive placebo, 100mg sitagliptin QD, or 20mg GSK1612435 BID.\n* Cohort 4: 20-40 subjects randomized to receive placebo, 100mg sitagliptin QD, or GSK1612435 BID, (potential doses of 0.25 to 40mg BID), depending on safety, tolerability, and glucose results of Cohorts 1, 2, and 3.\n* Cohort 5: 12 subjects randomized to receive placebo or GSK1614235 BID (potential doses of up to 80mg BID), depending on safety, tolerability, and glucose results of Cohorts 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n* Cohort 6: 24 subjects randomized to receive GSK1614235 BID (20BID), or sitagliptin (100mg QD).\n\nAfter subjects have successfully completed the screening procedures, they will be asked to discontinue prior anti-diabetic therapy at least 72 h before admission to the research facility and remain off of the medications until the completion of the follow-up visit (total of \\~14 days). Subjects will be admitted to the research facility on the evening of Day -2 in preparation to begin baseline assessments, including PD, on Day -1 (for their particular cohort). Beginning on Day 1, subjects will receive a single dose of GSK1614235 and undergo PK sampling, and on Day 2 through Day 6, subjects will be dosed on a twice daily dosing schedule with doses administered immediately before breakfast and the evening meal. Day 6 includes intensive assessments of PK and PD parameters in addition to routine safety monitoring.\n\nPart B is a double-blind, randomized, single-dose, 3-way crossover study in 12 subjects. A well-tolerated dose of GSK1614235 that provides a meaningful pharmacodynamic response based on data from Part A will be administered in both fed and fasted states. It is not anticipated that the dose for Part B will exceed single doses of 40mg.\n\nPart B will consist of 3 periods. Period 1 will begin after subjects have successfully completed screening. They will be admitted to the research facility the evening before dosing (Day -1) and will dose the following morning after an overnight (at least 12 hour fast). Safety monitoring and PK and PD sampling will be conducted over a 48 hour period. Subjects will be discharged from the research facility after the 48 hour PK and PD sample has been collected. A washout period of ≥ 5 days period will ensue, and subjects will be admitted to the research facility to begin Period 2. Period 3 will follow the same schedule as Period 1 and Period 2.\n\nSubjects will be randomized such that, at separate admissions, each subject receives the selected GSK1614235 dose or matching placebo as follows.\n\n* GSK1614235 before meal and placebo after meal\n* GSK1614235 30 min after meal and placebo before meal\n* Placebo - both before meal and 30 min after meal"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"],"keywords":["type 2 diabetes","single dose","3-O-methylglucose","healthy volunteer","repeat dose"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":72,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"GSK1614235","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Glucose lowering agent under investigation.","interventionNames":["Drug: GSK1614235"]},{"label":"Sitagliptin","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Glucose lowering comparator","interventionNames":["Drug: Sitagliptin"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo to match GSK1614235 and placebo to match Sitagliptin","interventionNames":["Other: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"GSK1614235","description":"Glucose lowering in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus","armGroupLabels":["GSK1614235"],"otherNames":["Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Sitagliptin","description":"Glucose lowering in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus","armGroupLabels":["Sitagliptin"],"otherNames":["Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Placebo","description":"Comparator","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"],"otherNames":["Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Part A: Safety, tolerability parameters: adverse events, gastro-intestinal side effects, subject reported outcomes, clinical laboratory results, ECGs and vital signs","timeFrame":"6 days"},{"measure":"Part B: Safety, tolerability parameters: adverse events, gastro-intestinal side effects, subject reported outcomes, clinical laboratory results, ECGs and vital signs","timeFrame":"1 day"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Part A: Pharmacokinetics","timeFrame":"6 days"},{"measure":"Part A: Pharmacodynamics","timeFrame":"6 days"},{"measure":"Part B: Pharmacokinetics","timeFrame":"1 day"},{"measure":"Part B: Pharmacodynamics","timeFrame":"1 day"},{"measure":"Part B: 3-O-Methyl-Glucose Kinetics","timeFrame":"1 day"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria Part A:\n\n* Subjects with documented type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosis whose HbA1c levels are \\>7 and at or less than 9.5%;

Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be controlled and blood will be drawn for HbA1c, the efficacy and the safety parameters. A POCT pregnancy test will be conducted in women of childbearing age. Patient demographics and history will be collect and a physical examination will be performed. The patient will complete a QoL questionnaire and will receive training about the de-escalation therapy approach. After all necessary biomarker results of the screening visit are accessible for the selection of the De-escalation treatment the treatment initiation visit will be performed. During this visit the investigator will use these results to determine a most optimal personalized treatment combination for regeneration of the pancreatic ß-cells within the next three months. An ECG will be recorded and the patient will be informed about his/her personalized treatment and its execution. The patient will receive the drugs in the volume required until the next visit. During the next two visits the patient will arrive at the investigational site at the agreed time-point and information regarding potential adverse events will be collected. Vital signs will be measured, and blood will be drawn for assessment of the efficacy parameters.

At the same time, to the best of our knowledge, the impact of metformin use and glycemic control on short- and long-term outcomes in this patient population is also controversial. Therefore, this study aims to test the hypothesis that diabetes mellitus is associated with reduced survival in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma undergoing minimally invasive esophagectomy and that treatment with metformin and/or good glycemic control (HbA1c\\<7.0%) is associated with improved survival.","detailedDescription":"Esophageal cancer is one of the major components of the global cancer burden. According to the Global Cancer Statistics 2020 report, in 2020, esophageal cancer ranked ninth in the world in incidence (604,100 new cases) and sixth in overall mortality (544,076 deaths). In China, esophageal cancer ranked fifth among cancer-related causes of death in 2020, with more than 90% of esophageal cancers being esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Until now, surgery-based comprehensive treatment has remained the main mode of treatment for patients with potentially curable localized esophageal cancer. However, despite efforts to advance treatment, the five-year survival rate for patients with esophageal cancer after surgery is still low, so it is important to identify prognosis-related factors.\n\nDiabetes is a global health problem that has reached alarming levels. In 2019, nearly half a billion people worldwide (9.3% of adults aged 20-79 years) had diabetes, with approximately 20% in the age group aged 60-75 years (the main incidence group of esophageal cancer). Diabetes mellitus is a wasting systemic disease associated with poor outcomes across multiple disease processes and is one of the greatest challenges facing healthcare systems worldwide. For malignant tumors, diabetes is not only one of the causes but also one of the risk factors for low survival. Although other cancer specialties (eg, colon, pancreatic, breast) are associated with poor oncology outcomes, it may be due to decreased immunity and increased systemic inflammation in patients with diabetes. However, there is controversy regarding the prognostic role of diabetes mellitus in patients undergoing surgery for esophageal cancer. There is evidence that patients with diabetes have an increased risk of cancer recurrence and death after surgery compared with non-diabetic controls; However, some studies have shown no significant association between T2DM and postoperative complications, suggesting that diabetes is not an independent risk factor for survival.\n\nMetformin, a member of the biguanide family, is commonly used as an oral antihyperglycemic agent that reduces cancer risk and improves prognosis for a variety of cancers. In recent years, the use of metformin has improved survival in patients with malignant tumors. For patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), several molecular mechanisms have been shown to inhibit tumor progression, for example, by inhibiting the growth of esophageal cancer cells. Metformin has also been shown to have a beneficial prognostic effect on some other tumors, such as colon, lung, and prostate cancers, in some studies. The association between metformin use and mortality in patients undergoing surgery for esophageal cancer has been analyzed with conflicting results. A study by Van De Voorde et al. showed that the use of metformin was associated with significantly better distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival. In contrast, the results of Spierings et al. showed that metformin use did not result in higher pathologic response rates or improved overall survival or disease-free survival. They believe that contrary to the assumptions of other tumor types, metformin may not have a beneficial effect on esophageal cancer.\n\nStudies have shown that T2DM does not appear to have a significant effect on the long-term survival of esophageal cancer patients undergoing esophagectomy. In contrast, it may be more important to control blood glucose levels in patients with T2DM undergoing esophagectomy. At the same time, a large number of studies have confirmed that diabetic patients with poor glycemic control have a higher complication rate after esophageal cancer surgery, especially anastomotic leakage.\n\nIn summary, there is controversy as to whether type II diabetes mellitus will result in adverse short- and long-term outcomes for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma undergoing minimally invasive esophagectomy. At the same time, to the best of our knowledge, the impact of metformin use and glycemic control on short- and long-term outcomes in this patient population is also controversial.

The main reason for this condition is either relative or near complete deficiency of essential hormone made by our pancreas called \"insulin\", which is required to utilize blood sugar (glucose), and insulin shortage leads to increased blood glucose. The common types of this condition include type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (the most common with almost 90% of all diabetes patients having this condition), which is related to mismatch of body requirements and production of essential hormone called insulin (relative deficiency) and type 1 diabetes, in which body's own defense system causes of destruction of insulin producing cells in the pancreas (near complete deficiency of insulin). However, in younger age group (below the age of 35) there is another type of diabetes which affects nearly 1 out 1000 people and is Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY). MODY is a condition passed by parents in 50% of the kids due to an affected single gene and most common forms of MODY do not require any Insulin treatment. However as type 1 Diabetes is generally identified in younger age group, 80% of patient who have MODY cannot be diagnosed and are labelled with other forms of diabetes instead, and may receive unnecessary insulin injections. Although, there has been a lot of research done in the west on prevalence of MODY in white/Caucasian population, the studies in Middle East are minimal. Also, in the white/Caucasian population, a reliable risk calculator has been developed that predicts the risk of having MODY, which if found to be high, is then confirmed by genetic testing for MODY. There is no study available on presence of MODY or on the reliability of the MODY risk calculator among young Emirati population. There is also no data on MODY being misdiagnosed as other forms of diabetes in Emirati population.\n\nThis study proposal aims to address this gap of knowledge and assess the reliability of MODY calculator in young Emirati patients with diabetes and to see if any MODY patient exist in Diabetes clinics of Tawam hospital Abu Dhabi, who may have been misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2.","detailedDescription":"Background:\n\nDiabetes Mellitus (DM) affects more than half a billion people world-over, and there are nearly 72 million patients with diabetes in Middle East \\& North Africa (MENA) region with United Arab Emirates having nearly a million of them.1 The most common type of DM is type 2 DM (nearly 90%) with impaired insulin secretion and usually associated with resistance to insulin actions, while others include gestational diabetes, DM secondary to pancreatic injury, immune mediated type 1 DM and monogenic diabetes. Monogenic diabetes encompasses previously termed maturity onset diabetes of the young as well as neonatal and mitochondrial disease all resulting from single gene defect. The prevalence of Monogenic Diabetes in European and North American population (mainly Caucasians) is 1/10,000 among adults, but for glucokinase (GCK) variant the prevalence can be as high as 1/1000. The prevalence of Monogenic Diabetes / MODY in Middle East population is not known with only two studies of more than 50 patients is Israel and Jordan mainly on GCK subtype. At present over 80% of Monogenic Diabetes patient are misdiagnosed and treated as either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus. The commonest forms of treatment-requiring MODY are HNF4-alpha and HNF1-alpha, which do not necessarily require insulin, hence correct diagnosis can be life changing of these patients. There is MODY risk calculator developed by Exeter University that helps predict the presence of Monogenic diabetes but it is validated for Caucasian population only with no data on Emirati population. There are no studies at present on either assessing the presence of MODY in United Arab Emirates population or on identifying MODY patients who are already misdiagnosed with other forms of diabetes.\n\nThe aim of this study to assess the presence of common forms of Monogenic diabetes by genetic testing in susceptible adolescents/adults (based on MODY calculator risk factors \\& antibody testing) who are already diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus (either type 1 or Type 2)\n\nObjective:\n\nPrimary:\n\nTo assess the frequency of MODY monogenic diabetes (commonest subtypes) among patients already labelled as Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes (who have negative autoimmunity, lack of significant ketosis and either family history of diabetes in one parent or BMI\\<40).\n\nSecondary:\n\n* To assess the validity of MODY risk calculator for prediction of monogenic diabetes in Emirati patients\n* To assess the validity of Insulin antibodies in ruling out monogenic diabetes\n* To assess the validity of C-peptide activity level in differentiating type 1 diabetes from type 2 diabetes and monogenic diabetes\n\nData Collection:\n\nThe paediatric and adult diabetes clinics in Tawam Hospital Diabetes clinics and clinicians therein will be contacted and any patient meeting the above-mentioned selection criteria will be identified. An informed consent will take from patient and/or parent/guardian explaining the risks and benefits of the study. The patient without insulin antibody testing will undergo testing and only those patients who have negative antibodies will undergo C-peptide activity level (either non-stimulated serum C-peptide or 2-hour post prandial urinary C-peptide creatinine ratio) and only those with absent/reduced C-peptide levels will be excluded. Demographic details and clinical parameters like BMI, duration of diabetes, treatment history and co-morbidities will be obtained. The patient's routine diabetes related blood tests including (HbA1c, liver function tests, albumin, bilirubin, Prothrombin time, albumin, creatinine) done in the last 3months and demographic data (non-identifiable) will be initially gathered on a data collection sheet which will then be transferred to electronic data in Microsoft Excel sheet and stored on a secure server. The MODY risk score will be calculated using the published formula (available at website https://www.diabetesgenes.org/exeter-diabetes-app/ModyCalculator).\n\nThe patient will be seen as per routine clinical care and on the next set of blood work additional vials of blood sample will be taken for monogenic testing. No separate venesection or additional visit for the patient will be required. Copy of the monogenic testing will be provided to the clinician in-charge of the patient to help with any clinical decisions.\n\nConfidentiality:\n\nNo patient specific identifiable data will be stored in this study. All other data stored will be on United Arab Emirates University secure server. The proposal will be sent to the Research and Ethics committee Tawam for approval as well as to UAEU human ethics committee.\n\nFunding:\n\nThere will be funding required for this study for additional testing (including C-peptide activity/antibody testing and genetic testing) as well as for research assistant for 2 years.\n\nConflict of interest:\n\nNone\n\nFinancial disclosure:\n\nNone"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Maturity-onset Diabetes of the Young","Monogenic Diabetes","MODY"],"keywords":["Maturity-onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY)","Diabetes Mellitus","Diagnosis","Precision Medicine"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"patients labelled as Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes","type":"OTHER","description":"paediatric or adult patients already diagnosed with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, following up with Tawam Hospital Diabetes clinics for at least 1 year, (who have negative autoimmunity, lack of significant ketosis and either family history of diabetes in one parent or BMI\\<40).\n\nPatient with age \\> 11; both male or female, Emirati patients only, who attended Diabetes clinic Tawam hospital during the last 1 year AND Diagnosed to have Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus diagnosed before the age of 40 and after the age of 6 months (to exclude neonatal diabetes).\n\n• .","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Genetic testing for 4 MODY genes (GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A, HNF1B)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Genetic testing for 4 MODY genes (GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A, HNF1B)","description":"Genetic testing for 4 MODY genes (GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A, HNF1B) to look for common non-syndromic MODY in Emirati population","armGroupLabels":["patients labelled as Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To see how many patient with diabetes diagnosed at early age with features not suggestive of type 1 or type 2 are found to have MODY monogenic diabetes (commonest subtypes) among young Emirati patients","description":"To assess the frequency of MODY monogenic diabetes (commonest subtypes) among patients already labelled as Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes (who have negative autoimmunity, lack of significant ketosis and either family history of diabetes in one parent or BMI\\<40).","timeFrame":"24 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To compare the value of MODY risk calculator and genetic testing outcome in Emirati patients","description":"To assess the validity of MODY risk calculator for prediction of monogenic diabetes in Emirati patients","timeFrame":"24 months"},{"measure":"To see if C-peptide activity helps in differentiating monogenic diabetes from type 1","description":"To assess the validity of C-peptide activity level in differentiating type 1 diabetes from type 2 diabetes and monogenic diabetes","timeFrame":"24 months"},{"measure":"To find out the antibodies present in young patient with diabetes and if they are helpful in ruling out monogenic diabetes","description":"To assess the validity of Insulin antibodies (anti-GAD65, IAA2, Anti-Zn8) in ruling out monogenic diabetes","timeFrame":"24 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age \\> 11; both male or female, Emirati patients only\n* Diagnosed to have Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus diagnosed before the age of 40 and after the age of 6 months.\n* Attended Tawam hospital during the last 1 year.\n* All previous antibodies testing being negative.\n* Absence of ketoacidosis / significant ketosis in the past medical records\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* BMI of 40 or above (class 3 / severe obesity)\n* History of Secondary diabetes (e.g. Diabetes following pancreatitis)\n* Absent/Decreased C-peptide activity suggestive of Type 1 Diabetes","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Years","maximumAge":"45 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Adnan Agha","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+971-3-7673333","phoneExt":"7677","email":"adnanagha@uaeu.ac.ae"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Adnan Agha","affiliation":"United Arab Emirates University, College of Medicine & Health Sciences","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"29473506","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Taneera J, Mussa B, Saber-Ayad M, Dhaiban S, Aljaibeji H, Sulaiman N.

The intrinsic correlation arises from shared metabolic processes, particularly a systemic and chronic inflammatory state driven by factors like obesity, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia. This leads to the creation of a self-sustaining microenvironment known as meta-inflammation, promoting cancer development through DNA damage, oxidative stress, and the influence of hormones like leptin. The hyperglycemic environment in diabetes contributes to cancer development, supporting the Warburg effect and insulin-related mechanisms. This study aims to identify risk factors associated with diabetes that impact tumor development and progression, crucial for guiding effective preventive strategies in clinical practice.\n\nPrimary objective of the study:\n\n- identify the risk factors affecting the occurrence of cancer in the population affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus;\n\nSecondary objectives of the study:\n\n* description of the demographic, clinical and first-line therapy characteristics of patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus;\n* assess risk factors for recurrence, presence of a second tumour not related to the first and the presence of both events in patients who have had a tumor within 10 years of diagnosis of diabetes;\n* assess the relationship between the characteristics of patients and the time to the onset of cancer.","detailedDescription":"Study design This study is a monocentric retrospective cohort study based on the data available in the Smart Digital Clinic (Meteda Srl) electronic medical record.\n\nParticipating centre Surgery of Endocrinology and Diabetology of the SCDU of Novara, University of Eastern Piedmont. Responsible: Prof.ssa Flavia Prodam\n\nSubjects Will be included in the study all patients visited at the Endocrinology and Diabetology surgery of the AOU Major of the Charity of Novara for an initial diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type 2 between 1990 and 2010.\n\nInclusion criteria\n\n* Legal age\n* Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus Exclusion criteria\n* Diagnosis of cancer before diagnosis of type 2 diabetes\n* Diagnosis of diabetes secondary to other diseases\n* Diagnosis of diabetes secondary to other drugs\n* Diagnosis of diabetes following surgery\n\nDuration of study: 24 months\n\nFollow-up and events of interest Patients included in the study will be followed from the date of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus until the date of the last available examination.\n\nDuring the follow-up, for all patients included, the year of onset of the first cancer after the diagnosis of diabetes and the type of tumor will be detected. From this information it will be possible to calculate the time between the diagnosis of diabetes and the onset of cancer (measured in years).\n\nFor patients who have developed a first tumor will also be detected:\n\n1. Recurrence of cancer (year of onset of recurrence)\n2. Diagnosis of second tumour not related to primary tumour (year of onset, type of tumour) The diagnosis of cancer will be identified through the extraction system from the electronic medical record Smart Digital Clinic (Meteda Srl), using key words relevant to the area of cancer, identified in the section of the medical history. The key words will be: metastasis, adenocarcinoma, carcinoma, neoplasm, secondary/s, sarcoma, tumor, adenoma, lymphoma, leukemia, glioma, glioblastoma, ependymoma, basalioma, epithelium, melanoma, mesothelioma, cordoma, anaplastic, differentiated, undifferentiated, meningioma, multiple myeloma, small cell carcinoma, timoma, craniopharyngioma, neuroendocrine, LH, LNH, K, GIST, HCC and NET.\n\nData collection\n\nFor each patient, the following variables will be extracted from the Smart Digital Clinic electronic medical record for all visits available after diagnosis, where possible:\n\n* Gender and age;\n* Smoking habits and alcohol consumption (units per day);\n* Weight and body mass index (BMI) at first (T0) and last visit (T1);\n* Given by the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus;\n* Treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus at T0 and T1;\n* Levels of glycated hemoglobin (hba1c) at T0 and T1, mean hba1c and mean fasting blood sugar;\n* Creatinine clearance at T0 and T1;\n* Liver enzymes at T0 and T1: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST);\n* T0 and T1 lipid profile: low density lipoproteins (LDL-c) and triglycerides (TG);\n* Complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus;\n* Treatment of cancer;\n* Family history of cancer; The diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus is confirmed at diabetological centres or, in some cases, by general practitioners who refer patients to specialised diabetological centres. The accuracy of the diagnosis will be confirmed by crossing the Piedmont Diabetic Registry (PDR) and involving a second person to ensure a precise assessment.\n\nBMI categories will be divided into underweight (BMI \\<18.5 Kg/m2), normal weight (BMI 18.5 - 25 Kg/m2), and overweight (BMI \\>25 Kg/m2).\n\nWith regard to the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, participants will be categorised and grouped for statistical purposes in the following classes:\n\n* Dietary therapy;\n* Metformin/Acarbosio;\n* Sulfanilurea;\n* Metformin + GLP1/ DDPIV inhibitors (DDPIVi) or only GLP1 or only DDPIVi;\n* Metformin + SGLT2i inhibitors (SGLT2i) or only SGLT2i;\n* Basal insulin + GLP1/DDPIVi +/- Metformin;\n* Basal insulin +/- Metformin +/- SGLT2i;\n* Insulin basal bolus;\n* Basal insulin bolus +/- Metformin +/- SGLT2i. In addition, complications of metabolic pathology will be extracted from the dedicated section of the program, where are systematically recorded and organized, and the diagnosis of which is conducted in accordance with the appropriate guidelines. These complications will be divided into the following categories: vasculopathy, neuropathy, hypertension, heart disease, kidney failure and retinopathy.\n\nFinally, as regards cancer pathology, a categorization of treatment will be carried out in three classes: chemotherapy, surgery and radiation therapy.\n\nIn addition, the types of cancer will be divided in order to ensure greater homogeneity between groups, including the nervous system, head and neck, thorax, gastrointestinal, gynecological, urinary tract, male genital system, skin, blood, breast, soft tissues, endocrine glands and neuroendocrine tumors. This information will be collected at the diabetes diagnosis visit and at the last visit before the onset of cancer for the subjects experiencing the event and at the last available visit for the remaining subjects.\n\nEXPECTED RESULTS Through this research, the investigators aim to obtain new information on the study population in order to better understand the possible correlation between the two pathologies. This will allow us to identify the risk factors associated with metabolic pathology that can affect the development time of cancer pathologies, as well as to identify those that could contribute to carcinogenesis itself.\n\nThis knowledge will allow us to define the role of hyperglycemia, obesity and other factors or behaviors at risk in the field of cancer in order to act with appropriate prevention strategies, thus considering the tumor pathology as one of the possible complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2","Cancer"],"keywords":["cancer","diabetes mellitus type 2"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":779,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Diabetes mellitus type 2 and cancer","description":"779 patients with cancer and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed between 1990 and 2010","interventionNames":["Other: phenotyping of patients followed at a third-level diabetes centre with cancer"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"phenotyping of patients followed at a third-level diabetes centre with cancer","description":"Collection of the following data for each patient enrolled, where possible:\n\n* Gender and age;\n* Smoking habits and alcohol consumption (units per day);\n* Weight and body mass index (BMI) at first (T0) and last visit (T1);\n* Given by the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus;\n* Treatment of type 2 diabetes at T0 and T1;\n* Levels of glycated hemoglobin (hba1c) at T0 and T1, mean hba1c and mean fasting blood sugar;\n* Creatinine clearance at T0 and T1;\n* Liver enzymes at T0 and T1: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST);\n* T0 and T1 lipid profile: low density lipoproteins (LDL-c) and triglycerides (TG);\n* Complications of type 2 diabetes;\n* Treatment of cancer;\n* Family history of cancer.","armGroupLabels":["Diabetes mellitus type 2 and cancer"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Smoking assessment at first visit","description":"identify the risk factors affecting the occurrence of cancer in the population affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus: During the first examination, the history of each patient was investigated, evaluating whether they were smokers, non-smokers or ex smokers","timeFrame":"Assessment of data at time 0 (first clinical visit)"},{"measure":"Alcool consumption at first visit","description":"identify the risk factors influencing the onset of cancer in the population affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus: During the first examination, the history of each patient was studied, assessing whether I consume alcohol and in what amount. \\<1 alcohol unit or greater than 2 alcohol units were used as cutoffs to subdivide the patients considered.","timeFrame":"Assessment of data at time 0 (first clinical visit)"},{"measure":"BMI assessment at first visit","description":"identify the risk factors influencing the onset of cancer in the population affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus: During the first examination, the history of each patient was studied, measuring weight and height to calculate the BMI of each patient.

The prevalence of diabetes in hospitalised patients is up to 40%, meaning that the anaesthesiologist will encounter a diabetes patient in the operating room on a daily basis. Multiple protocols for perioperative glucose regulation have been developed, ranging from intravenous glucose-insulin-potassium infusion to subcutaneous bolus regimens. Despite this abundance of published glucose lowering protocols and the proven negative effects of intraoperative hyperglycaemia in diabetes, there is no evidence regarding the optimal intraoperative glucose lowering treatment. Recently, incretins have been introduced to lower blood glucose. The main hormone of the incretin system is glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).

This study aim to check the effect of eccentric exercises on Glycemic index, quality of life, strength, exertion, balance and proprioception in type II Diabetes Mellitus patients","detailedDescription":"From the last three decades, the diabetes mellitus progress quadrupled.The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) approximate that 1 in 11 adults with age between 20 to 79 years have diabetes mellitus. Almost 90 percent of patients diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus are type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. According to the World Health Organization, Diabetes mellitus could be 7th leading cause of death. Type II Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) increase progressively that affect around 25 million people in Europe and major public health issue for middle income countries. It is proposed that the prevalence of diabetes mellitus will increase up to 67% in middle-income countries from 2010 to 2030. In Pakistan, the Type II Diabetes Mellitus prevalence in 2018 is 11.77%. The prevalence is more in male as compared to females and urban area have 14.81 percent as compared to rural area.\n\nThe genetic architecture might partially determine an individual's response to environmental changes.The risk factors of Type II Diabetes Mellitus include obesity, ageing, behavioral and environment factors, diet and lifestyle. School-age children had also warned of a rise in childhood obesity in Pakistan, which is considered a strong risk factor in diabetic patients. The major cause of Type II Diabetes Mellitus is deficiency or loss of insulin. Brain utilize glucose as source of energy and when brain is unable to maintain integrity, Many physiological mechanism initiates to reduce and limit the effect of hypoglycemia.The response of human body in reaction to reduce glucose level causes lowering the secretion of insulin and release counter-regulatory hormone.Diabetes mellitus have strong correlation for reduction in muscular strength and functional status.\n\nA recent study on global burden of diseases, Diabetes mellitus considered as ninth major cause of reduced life expectancy. A study conducted decades ago concluded that 3.96 million deaths occur due to diabetes mellitus with aged between 20-79 years. According to the International Diabetes Federation, the number and complications of diabetes mellitus increase rapidly up to 5.0 million deaths due to metabolic disorder.The prevalence of disability occurrence due to diabetes mellitus increase significantly since 3 decades ago. According to the global burden of Disease, Injuries and Risk factor statement, the 10th most common factor of disability was fasting level of glucose in 1990, 4th common cause till 2005 and 3rd common cause in 2015.45.8 percent of diabetes mellitus patients were approximately not diagnosed. Those patient who are not diagnosed have more risk of complication as compared to those who are diagnosed and start intervention. Medical expenditure of diabetes mellitus patients increases three times more than general population.The cases of people living suffering from Type II Diabetes Mellitus increase quadrupled between 1980 and 2014 globally. Adults who have diagnosed diabetes mellitus enhance to 20 percent from 2010 to 2030 and predicted to increase rapidly up to 69 percent. In Asia, the epidemic of Type II Diabetes Mellitus progress very rapidly and characterized by onset at a lower BMI and younger age than in Western populations. An average cost for the treatment of Diabetes Mellitus in Pakistan ranges from 650 to 20000 PKR."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Type II Diabetes Mellitus"],"keywords":["Dose response","Eccentric exercise","Type II Diabetes Mellitus","Glycemic index"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":59,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group includes 15 male participants who will be given 10 minutes of warm and cool down sessions that includes stationary bicycle without resistance and stretching.

The pathology results in hyperglycemia, disorders or insufficiency of several organs. OBJECTIVE: to verify the effectiveness of adopting the practice of educational groups in primary care and the multidisciplinary role in the control of diabetes mellitus in adults. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND: type II diabetes mellitus (type II DM) is a pathology that represents a high risk for cardiovascular, renal, ophthalmological complications and in several other systems. It is considered a major issue to be controlled by health services, as the high cost of treatments related to the sequelae of type II DM, as well as high rates of hospitalizations and associated therapies have been increasing and decompensating public budgets. Primary care has a fundamental role in preventing the disease and associated complications. METHODOLOGY: randomized clinical study conducted in an educational group at the Basic Health Unit Nova Bonsucesso with six monthly meetings scheduled with 24 patients with type II diabetes mellitus users of oral hypoglycemic agents divided into two subgroups: 12 users in the control group and 12 users in the group study (which will receive the interventions of the multidisciplinary team) and will be accompanied by laboratory tests and individual evaluations to verify the effectiveness of the multidisciplinary performance in the control of diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: the participants are expected to show improvements in the control of the pathology and awareness about the relevance of self-care, facts that will be observed through laboratory data and

According to the International Guidelines and Recommendations, people with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) should attend diabetes educational programmes periodically and optimize the metabolic index of control. In Hong Kong, General Practitioners with solo-practice (GP-SP) have the least availability of resources and support in DM management. A discrepancy of diabetes care between public and private settings and a gap of clinical practice between public-private healthcare settings is identified. In relation to the big population of T2DM is caring by GP-SP but no structured Diabetes Care Programme (DCP) is in place. A structured DCP for T2DM is in need to fill up the clinical gap and make beneficial to the target subjects.\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a DCP for people with T2DM in primary care settings. It is a multi-center, single-blind randomized controlled trial with parallel groups pre-test and post-test design. The evidence-based intervention (DCP) will be carried out in a private primary care setting. People with T2DM attending the GP-SP who meet the study criteria will be randomly assigned into one of the two study groups, either \"DCP in addition to usual medical care\" or \"Usual medical care only\" as a control group. The intervention group can beneficial in clinical and psychosocial outcomes after the completion of the 20-week structured DCP with a greater improvement of HbA1c level, Self-Efficacy in diabetes management, Diabetes Empowerment level, Diabetes Knowledge, and Quality of Life than those who only received usual medical care at the GP-SP.","detailedDescription":"This study is to implement an evidence-based develop Diabetes Care Programme (DCP) for 152 adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in a few clinics of a general practitioner with solo-practice (GP-SP) in community, and evaluate its effectiveness by comparing the outcomes between study group (DCP with the usual medical care) and control group (Usual medical care only). It is believed that a structured DCP can promote greater clinical outcomes improvement and behavioral changes in the study group as evidence showed in literature. The primary outcomes are glycemic control (HbA1c level) and Self-Efficacy in diabetes management; whereas Diabetes Empowerment level, Diabetes Knowledge and Quality of Life are the secondary outcomes.\n\nThe DCP consists of two parts, conduct 3 interactive group education with an innovative educational tool \"Diabetes Conversation Map™\" sessions by dietitian and diabetes educator/nurse. Then it followed by another 8 weeks for delivering two 15-30 minutes teleconsultations for patient empowerment and follow-up of \"Action Plan\" by a diabetes educator/nurse. Evaluation of outcomes will be done before the DCP (baseline), at week-8 (right after the group sessions), and at week-20 (4 weeks after the last teleconsultation).\n\nIn addition, a focus group interview will be carried out after the completion of the whole intervention. It purposes to explore and get valuable descriptive information and feelings from participants about the intervention and diabetes self-management."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"],"keywords":["Diabetes Care Programme","Diabetes Conversation Map","Type 2 diabetes mellitus"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized control trial","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"single-blind","whoMasked":["CARE_PROVIDER"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":152,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Diabetes Care Programme","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"People with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus of private general practitioner (GP) with solo-practice who receive the intervention (Diabetes Care Programme) in addition to usual medical care at the GP","interventionNames":["Other: Diabetes Care Programme"]},{"label":"Standard Usual Care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"People with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus of private general practitioner (GP) with solo-practice who only receive the usual medical care at the GP"}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Diabetes Care Programme","description":"20-week Diabetes Care Programme consists of three Diabetes Conversation Map sessions in 8 weeks with 3-4 weeks intervals, then two teleconsultations at week 12th and week 16th","armGroupLabels":["Diabetes Care Programme"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)","description":"Glycemic control","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline HbA1c at week 20"},{"measure":"Self-efficacy level in diabetes management","description":"To assess the Self-efficacy level in diabetes management of Chinese people with diabetes.

The purpose of this study is to establish a prediction model for the occurrence, development, and severity of cognitive impairment by using machine learning of Papez circuit neural network in T2DM patients. This will allow for early intelligent assessment with high accuracy and efficiency, and assist in clinical personalized treatment and early intervention. The research center has 1 principal investigator, 4 sub-investigators, and 1 nurse. Participants will include 200 patients with type 2 diabetes recruited from outpatient and inpatient departments. Additionally, 200 healthy controls will be recruited from the community. Each subject will undergo clinical information collection, biochemical measurements including fasting blood glucose, C-peptide, HbA1c, blood lipid, postprandial blood glucose, and postprandial C-peptide, multimodal MRI scans, and cognitive assessments at baseline and each follow-up visit. The study duration is 6 years, with a follow-up every 36 months.

The invented names of the drugs containing basal insulin, metformin and sulfonylurea derivatives used as standard type II diabetes mellitus therapy, should be unchanged for each patient during the whole trial.\n\nAll patients will receive glucometers and the appropriate glucose test strips, so they could self monitor blood glucose and register this data in their diaries.\n\nThe trial duration is 38 weeks; the main stages of the trial are conducted during screening, then in 4 weeks (Visit 2), in 12 weeks (Visit 3), in 24 weeks (Visit 4) and in 36 weeks (Visit 5). In 1 week after randomization and the onset of the trial therapy and between the visits to the study site (on weeks 8±1, 18±1and 30±1) an investigator collects data on patient's health and complaints (phone visits) to decide whether it is necessary to arrange unplanned visit to the site."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Type II Diabetes Mellitus"],"keywords":["Combined Treatment of Patients With Type II Diabetes Mellitus"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":190,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Subetta","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Subetta"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Subetta","description":"Each Subetta tablet contains a mixture of affinity purified polyclonal antibodies to β-subunit of the rINS (6 mg) and antibodies to eNOS (6 mg) in released-active form produced by the patented technology in accordance with the applicable European Pharmacopeia requirements.\n\nStandard therapy of type II diabetes mellitus + Subetta (1 tablet 4 times a day) for 36 weeks.\n\nSubetta: oral administration, per 1 intake - 1 tablet (keep in the mouth until complete dissolution, not at mealtime).","armGroupLabels":["Subetta"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Placebo (identical to Subetta in shape and taste tablet containing exсipients).

Today, diabetes is an increasingly important health problem due to its incidence and the problems it causes. In DM, macrovascular and microvascular complications are observed with the disease. It may lead to development of foot deformities, biomechanical abnormalities and loss of protective sensation in the foot due to motor, sensory and autonomic neuropathy especially in the lower extremity. In the progressive process, loss of protective sensation may result in peripheral neuropathy. In the literature, loss of protective sensation is shown as the primary cause of peripheral neuropathy. In a study, it was found that light touch pressure, two-point discrimination and vibration senses on the soles of the feet of patients with diabetes mellitus decreased compared to healthy individuals. Diabetic foot is an important complication of diabetes which can be prevented with patient education and early treatment, although mortality, morbidity and treatment costs are quite high. This condition affects the individual's life in many aspects. When reseracher examine the literature, most of the studies on physical activity, functional capacity and quality of life in individuals with Type 2 DM with neuropathy examine the effect of neuropathy on these parameters. There is little literature examining the effect of protective sensory loss before the development of neuropathy. Researcher think that it is important to evaluate the sole sensation before the development of neuropathy in type 2 DM patients in order to determine the risk factors. Researcher also think that we will contribute to the literature by examining the relationship between the level of protective sensory loss and muscle strength, functional capacity, balance and physical activity level.\n\nThe study is planned to include 30 volunteer participants diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. In this prospective study based on face-to-face interview method; body fat (%), skeletal muscle mass (%) (with Omron BF511 Body Composition Monitor), waist and hip circumference, lower extremity muscle strength (for quadriceps and biceps muscles) (with muscle hand held dynamometer), It is planned to measure upper extremity muscle strength (grip strength) (with hand grip dynamometer), functional capacity (with 6 Minute Walk Test), postural stability, stability limits and sensory integration of balance (with Biodex Balance System®).

GDM complicates 5 to 25% of pregnancies, depending on the diagnostic criteria used and the population being studied.\n\nGDM is an important red flag: up to 70% women with GDM will develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) during their lifetime. Accordingly, professional associations recommend T2DM postpartum screening (T2DM-pP-S), 6-to-24 weeks after delivery. A 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) should be performed for diagnosis (gold standard). Nevertheless, this T2DM-pP-S recommendation has failed worldwide for the same reasons: the presently impractical pattern of the testing. A solution is direly needed.\n\nOur overall goal is to improve detection of pre-diabetes and diabetes and more specifically, to facilitate the recommended T2DM-pP-S in women diagnosed with GDM.\n\nWe hypothesize that, in GDM women, results of an OGTT performed after delivery, before hospital discharge (OGTT-1) predict results of the recommended OGTT at 6-to-12 weeks postpartum (OGTT-2). Our aims are:\n\n1. To validate in Caucasian women the predictive threshold value of the 2hr-glucose of OGTT-1 established by our Stage-1 study.\n2. To determine, in a multiethnic non-Caucasian cohort, the threshold value for the 2hr-glucose of OGTT-1 that is predictive of abnormal glucose tolerance at OGTT-2.\n3. To define the OGTT time preference of women (before hospital discharge vs. 6-to-12 weeks postpartum).\n\nIf our results are in line with our Stage-1 data, most redundant 6-to-24 weeks postpartum OGTT will be avoided.

This diabetes score comprises visits to the doctor, lifestyle consultations, clinical measures such as blood pressure, cholesterol or blood sugar, as well as measures concerning the prevention of secondary complications like kidney, eye or feet issues. The participating primary care practices need to treat 80% of their diabetes patients (their \"diabetes population\") in accordance to the score-criteria. In addition to the adherence to the eight score-criteria, the practices are required to also document statistically if their diabetes patients get the following medication: oral antidiabetics, insulin, blood pressure medication, statins and / flu vaccine. As this observational study is and before-and-after study, the primary care practices need to document for each of their diabetes patients the care they provided in the year before the introduction of the score-criteria and in the year following their introduction. Participating primary care practices ask their diabetes patients' consent to the documentation and anonymous transmittance of their data. Data evaluation is anonymous and on a population-based level (as opposed to individual-based). The hypothesis of the study is to prove that the implementation of evidence-based measures, such as a diabetes score can increase the treatment quality of diabetes patients in primary care practices and this increase is independent of the primary care practice structure in which it is applied.","detailedDescription":"Information of the primary care practices regarding the background and goal of the project by means of a letter and informative documentation.\n\nRecruitment of primary care practices, divided into three different practice organisations (individual practices and group practices run on a private basis and with financial autonomy, as well as forms of joint practices with employed physicians without financial autonomy).\n\nA signed contract between QualiCCare and participating primary care practices regulates the collaboration.\n\nProcedure:\n\nA baseline documentation takes place retrospectively from the training/workshop for the past 12 months, and a second, prospective documentation of the treatment is done during the following 12 months.\n\nTraining of the participating general practioners (GP) and practice coordinator on the project including evaluation software, data entry and background to the criteria.\n\nDocumentation of the treatment quality of all patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 in a practice structure that meets the inclusion criteria according to the score criteria (baseline).\n\nAfter 12 months, the treatment quality of the included patients with diabetes type 2 is recorded again using the same score."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2","Primary Care"],"keywords":["Best practice","optimisation of treatment","diabetes score","diabetes in primary care"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":738,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"single primary care practices intervention","description":"Independent primary care practices with one single medical doctor in the practice, usually ther owner of the practice working in his responsibility following the best practice procedure of the diabetes score.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Best Practice Diabetes Management in Primary Care"]},{"label":"primary care group practice intervention","description":"Independent primary care practices with more than one medical doctor working in their responsibility following the best practice procedure of the diabetes score.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Best Practice Diabetes Management in Primary Care"]},{"label":"single primary care practices no intervention","description":"Independent primary care practices with one single medical doctor in the practice, usually ther owner of the practice working in his responsibility without the intervention (not using Diabetes score)"},{"label":"primary care group practice no intervention","description":"Independent primary care practices with more than one medical doctor working in their responsibility without the intervention (not using Diabetes score)."}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Best Practice Diabetes Management in Primary Care","description":"Practice adherence to best practice guidelines treating diabetes patients in different primary care practices is shown in this before- and after observational study","armGroupLabels":["primary care group practice intervention","single primary care practices intervention"],"otherNames":["Diabetes Score"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in score result before and after the introduction of the diabetes score criteria for treatment of diabetes patients in the primary care setting","description":"The change is measured at baseline, before the introduction of the diabetes score criteria and one year after the introduction.\n\nThere are 8 score criteria for the good diabetes management in primary care (such as 1x/y lifestyle consultation, 1x/foot control, etc).

This results in high blood sugar levels. About half of people with T2DM also have a condition called chronic kidney disease (CKD). In people with CKD, the kidneys' ability to work as how it should decreases over time.\n\nIn this study, researchers want to learn more about the CKD in T2DM patients in Alberta, Canada. This will help them to know the chances to improve the care of these patients.\n\nThe researchers will look at the health information from adult men and women in Alberta who were diagnosed with T2DM before 2018 and visited a doctor to have check-ups in 2018. They will find out about how many of these people had CKD and how severe their CKD was. The researchers will collect data about the age and gender of these patients, how long they had T2DM and if they had other related medical problems. The researchers will also learn how these patients were treated based on their kidney condition and how much money was spent on these treatments.\n\nThis study will collect information from the health records of about 270,000 patients with T2DM who were living in Alberta, Canada. This information will come from the Alberta Kidney Disease Network (AKDN) database.

The HgA1c test will tell us about the patients average blood sugar over the past 3 months, which will allow us to immediately diagnose new and uncontrolled type II diabetics. All participants will fill out a survey on healthcare seeking behaviors before glucose testing. All patients who enter the study will receive education on T2D and the value of regularly visiting their PCP, and will be provided a list of PCP currently accepting new patients within a 3 mile radius.

In addition, the patients had to be on stable doses of oral antidiabetics for at least the previous 90 days. By contrast, patients with lack of motivation or unable to use social networks, unable to read or write in Spanish, previous history of psychiatric disorder or serious organic disease, using systemic corticosteroids (\\>10 days in treatment), or being pregnant, were excluded. Outpatients were recruited during one year from the Endocrinology Depart-ments of the Virgen Macarena Hospital (Seville), and Juan Ramón Jiménez Hospital (Huelva).\n\nAll patients received specific information about DM, treatments and potential complications. Then, patients were randomized to the digital intervention group or usual care. Those patients randomized to the intervention group were educated in the use of different social networks with access to information re-lated to healthy lifestyle habits, dietary support, optimization of physical activity, insulin titration, therapeutic targets, self-care, based on validated material from scientific societies and endorsed in diabetes education. Patients also had the valuable resource of a Digital Diabetes Coach: an online expert specializing in therapeutic education. This virtual guide provided patients with the flexibility to interact in both unidirectional and bidirectional ways, using methods such as chat boxes, audio messages, videos, and more. Through this digital medium, patients could seek guidance and have their questions resolved. The Digital Diabetes Coach operated under the supervision of a multidisciplinary team, endocrinologists, nutritionists, and certified diabetes educators. This team en-sured that patients received comprehensive support and guidance tailored to their individual needs. Patient interactions were facilitated through a variety of digital platforms, which were selected based on the patient's preferences and in consultation with their Digital Diabetes Coach. These interactions aimed to provide essential support and motivation for patients. The communication channels employed included email, Skype, WhatsApp, telephone calls, and video conferencing, allowing for flexibility and convenience in connecting with patients. The main communication channels used in this study included tele-phone calls, WhatsApp, email and Skype video calls. Among them, WhatsApp was the preferred application by patients to ask questions and share information with professionals, regardless of their educational and socioeconomic level. Patients with higher educational levels also felt comfortable with communication through videoconferencing, while this medium was not the most desired by patients with a lower educational level or those from rural areas. In addition, webinars through Instagram in real time or recorded were also used. Furthermore, a comprehensive diabetes education program was introduced on a weekly basis, with 30-45 minutes sessions. This program covered a wide spectrum of critical topics, including proper injection techniques, dosage adjustments for medications, strategies for managing adverse events, personalized recommendations for physical activity, guidance on blood glucose profiling and interpretation, strategies for handling hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, portion controlled dietary plans, and insights into potential health conditions associated with poor macro and microvascular control. The educational materials used for these sessions were sourced from scientific societies, external companies endorsed by these societies, as well as materials developed by our center. To ensure effective communication and timely assistance, a two-way communication system was established. Patients were encouraged to seek answers to their questions and access information on-demand through messenger apps and other digital platforms. This approach allowed for a responsive and patient-centered approach to addressing individual needs and concerns. During the different interventions, patients were promoted to send data on weight, capillary blood glucose, activation of pedometers on their mobile phone etc.\n\nIn the control group, visits to the specialists (i.e., endocrinologist) were performed every 3 months, that included diabetes education intervention by the nursing staff (i.e., use of medication, adherence to treatment and basic guidelines for the management of their diabetes), for around 30 minutes in each consultation.\n\nAt baseline, demographic data, educational level, employment status, physical examination, treatment for diabetes (total insulin dose), and analytical data within the 12 weeks before inclusion were collected. Data was obtained from each electronic clinical history and glucose levels from the Libreview system. During the intermediate visit (3 months±15 days from base-line), physical examination, number of scans, adherence, verification that the patient adequately understood the material delivered and made use of social networks, changes of treatment, regular diabetes education, and adverse events since last visit were recorded. As this was a routine visit, the education activities by the staff (nursing and endocrine specialist) were homogeneous in both groups. At study end (6 months±15 days from baseline), physical examination, number of scans, adherence, verification that the patient adequately understood the material delivered and made use of social networks, changes of treatment, regular diabetes education and adverse events since last visit were recorded. For changes of treatment, the total dose of insulin was considered, rather than maximum or minimum doses of insulin. Changes in body composition along the study were also analyzed, including body fat mass, visceral fat area, fat-free mass and skeletal muscle mass, through segmental analysis of multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance (SMF-BIA; Inbody 770, In-body Co,Ltd, Korea).\n\nAdditionally, at baseline and at study end, different validated questionnaires were fulfilled by the patients.\n\nThe Quality of Life was evaluated with the Spanish version of the Diabetes Quality of Life Questionnaire (EsDQOL). This questionnaire has 4 sections: satisfaction (15 questions, with a score that ranges from 1 \\[very satisfied\\] to 5 \\[not at all satisfied\\]; 15 points implies great satisfaction), im-pact (17 questions, with a score that ranges from 1 \\[never\\] to 5 \\[always\\]; 17 points indicates that DM has little impact on daily life), social/vocational concerns (7 questions, with a score that ranges from 1 \\[never\\] to 5 \\[always\\]; 7 points indicates that DM causes little worry on a daily basis), and DM re-lated concerns (4 questions, with a score that ranges from 1 \\[never\\] to 5 \\[al-ways\\]; 4 points indicates that diabetes causes little worry on a daily basis).\n\nThe knowledge that DM patients had of diabetes was evaluated by the ECODI scale (scale of knowledge about diabetics). This scale has 25 items with 4 possible answers.\n\nThe eight items of Clarke's questionnaire were used to evaluate the perception about hypoglycemia. This scale has a total score of 0 to 7. Higher scores indicate diminished awareness.\n\nThe 4-item Morisky-Green scale was used to evaluate medication adherence. This scale has a total score of 0 to 4. A score of four denotes high adherence.\n\nPatient's healthcare experience was assessed with the \"Instrument for Evaluation of the Experience of Chronic Patients\" (IEXPAC) questionnaire. This is a self-administered, 12-item, multiple-choice questionnaire. Items 1 to 10 describe the patient's experience in the last six months in three domains (productive interactions, new model of the patient's relationship/interaction with the healthcare system, and patient's self-care). The last 2 questions only apply to patients who have been hospitalized, not be-ing counted in the total of answers. As a result, the overall score ranges from 0 (worst experience) to 10 (best experience)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus Type 2"],"keywords":["tyoe 2 Diabetes Mellitus","digital","metabolic control","social networks"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"randomization was carried out by a person external to the study","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":85,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Non intervention, usual parctice","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Usual practice"},{"label":"digital intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Behavioral: diabetes eduaction This was a multicenter, randomized, prospective study that included adults with type 2 diabetes with poor metabolic control, who started treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists, with the ability to use digital tools, especially via smartphone.

The metabolic risk factors that can predict diabetes after 10 years in a Circassians population-based sample of people who were aged 35 years or older and living in Israel.\n2. To define the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Circassians minority in Israel.\n\nThe hypothesis of the study:\n\nHigh fasting glucose has the most powerful predictive value for type 2 diabetes mellitus in the future.\n\nThe claimed importance of the study:\n\nFinding a powerful risk factor for future diabetes mellitus can contribute to intensifying the preventive measures in a small part of the population, by that to reduce the incidence of new diabetes without increasing the health cost.","detailedDescription":"Research design and methods The present study is a 10 year, nested prospective cohort, population-based survey of the metabolic syndrome risk factors including type 2 diabetes mellitus. The original cross-sectional survey was conducted in two small Circassian villages in north Israel with 4000 inhabitants. The baseline evaluation was performed between 1996 and - 1997. Among the 739 randomly selected men (n=289) and women (n=450 of the 4000 individuals who were aged 35 years or older. Mean age of men was 53.2±11.8 years and of women was 52± years. Mean BMI for men and women was 27.5± and 29.4± Kg/m2, respectively. Plasma glucose level for men and women was mg/dL(22).\n\nThe investigators will recruit the same cohort in the proposed study and individuals who were free of diabetes at base line will be included. The number of deceased changed their residence and those who will decline to participate in the follow-up study will be reported.\n\nThe protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Ziv hospital and all participants will give an informed consent.\n\nClinical data. Body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose, blood total cholesterol, triglycerides, low density cholesterol (LDL), high density cholesterol (HDL) and blood pressure measurements were done 10 years ago. In the present study, after 8 hours of caloric fast, blood glucose levels will be tested and patients will be asked about known recent diabetes mellitus in the last 10 years or treatment by dietary, hypoglycemic drugs or insulin.\n\nLaboratory data. In the morning, after an overnight caloric fast, venous blood will be sampled for the measurement of plasma concentrations of glucose. The blood levels of glucose will be done by Olympus 640 at ZIV hospital. Diagnosis of diabetes. At baseline and at the 10-year follow-up, the presence of diabetes will be established according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (84), i.e., when fasting glucose will be ≥126 mg/dl or when the participants will have a clinical diagnosis of the disease and treatment was ongoing (diet, drugs).\n\nThe presence of the disease will be confirmed by reviewing the medical records of their general practitioners. No case of diabetes will be accepted without a validated confirmation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus Type II"],"keywords":["2 diabetes mellitus,Circassians, High fasting glucose"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":670,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Rehania village (Kfar Rehania)","description":"Circassian community","interventionNames":["Other: NONE intervention"]},{"label":"Kama village (Kfar Kama )","description":"Circassian community","interventionNames":["Other: NONE intervention"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"NONE intervention","description":"NONE intervention","armGroupLabels":["Kama village (Kfar Kama )","Rehania village (Kfar Rehania)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"New incidences of Type II Diabetes Mellitus in Circassians minority in Israel","timeFrame":"14 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nPrevious participation in similar study which was occured 10 years ago\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nnone","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"35 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Circassians in Israel","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Osamah Hussein, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+972 505324913","email":"osama.h@ziv.health.gov.il"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Ziv Medical Center","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Safed","zip":"13110","country":"Israel","contacts":[{"name":"Osamah Hussein, MD","role":"CONTACT","email":"osama.h@ziv.health.gov.il"},{"name":"Osamah Hussein, MD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":32.96465,"lon":35.496}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2025-04-17"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D003920","term":"Diabetes Mellitus"},{"id":"D003924","term":"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D044882","term":"Glucose Metabolism Disorders"},{"id":"D008659","term":"Metabolic Diseases"},{"id":"D004700","term":"Endocrine System Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M7115","name":"Diabetes Mellitus","asFound":"Diabetes Mellitus","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M7119","name":"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2","asFound":"Diabetes Mellitus Type II","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11639","name":"Metabolic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M25403","name":"Glucose Metabolism Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7862","name":"Endocrine System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC18","name":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC19","name":"Gland and Hormone Related Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]}},"hasResults":false},

One of these sexual dysfunctions includes diminished penile length. It is currently unknown if the decreased length is due to earlier erectile dysfunction or secondary to diabetes itself. Penile traction therapy is one of several treatments which have been used historically to treat decreased penile length, however, to date, no studies have evaluated the role of traction therapy in men with diabetes. To accomplish the study, a population of men from Mayo Clinic with a diagnosis of diabetes, type II will be enrolled and will be randomized to utilize the device for varying amounts of time. Outcomes will be assessed at the 3 and 6 month time points, and the results are to be used with the intent to publish in a scientific journal."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2","Penile Diseases"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","interventionModelDescription":"Patients will be randomized into one of four groups:\n\n1.

Several studies have shown benefits of statin among patients of type 2 DM, however, no such data is available for patients with type 1 DM.\n\nIt is known from studies on cholesterol metabolism using surrogate markers that patients with type 1 DM have higher cholesterol absorption compared to normals and those with type 2 DM have higher cholesterol synthesis. Since statins inhibit synthesis, patients with type 1 DM may not have a good response and may respond better to cholesterol absorption inhibitors. The purpose of this study is to determine the cholesterol lowering effects of cholesterol absorption inhibitors and cholesterol synthesis inhibitors in subjects with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.","detailedDescription":"Hypothesis:\n\n1. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors like ezetimibe are more effective in lowering cholesterol in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus . The primary outcome measures are LDL cholesterol and cholesterol tracer absorption.\n2. Cholesterol synthesis inhibitors like statins are more effective in lowering cholesterol in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary outcomes are LDL cholesterol and 24 Hour urinary mevalonic acid levels.\n3. Response to statin is related to basal cholesterol synthesis rates. The primary outcomes are LDL cholesterol and 24 Hour urinary mevalonic acid levels.\n4. Response to ezetimibe is related to basal absorption rates. The primary outcome measures are LDL cholesterol, phytosterol levels and cholesterol tracer absorption.\n\nSpecific Aims:\n\n1. Measure baseline sterol absorption using plant sterol levels and and synthesis by using 24 h excretion of urinary mevalonic acid levels in type 1 and type 2 subjects\n2. Measure changes in lipid parameters, cholesterol synthesis and absorption markers in type 1 and type 2 subjects before and after 6 week therapy with simvastatin and 6 week therapy with ezetimibe after a 4 week washout period\n3. Start collecting blood for future genetic analysis for polymorphisms in cholesterol absorption genes\n\nSpecific Methods:\n\nVISIT 1: Evaluation of all the subjects that are willing to participate in the study would be carried out at the GCRC until required sample size is recruited and will include the following:\n\n1. Sign informed consent\n2. Complete a health questionnaire that has a standardized format to collect basic information regarding past and current medical history\n3. Physical exam that includes measurement of blood pressure, height, weight, waist and hip circumference will be performed.\n4. Blood (30ml) would be drawn for baseline chemistry including creatinine, ALT, CPK, fasting lipid panel, Apo-B, Apo A1, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and serum pregnancy test in women of child bearing age. Urine will be collected for urine analysis and presence of protein in the urine\n5. Evaluation of inclusion/exclusion criteria Subjects fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria would be recruited into the study\n\nFollowing specific procedures will be followed:\n\nAt the start of the study, subjects who are already on any lipid lowering medication will be asked to stop the medications 4 weeks prior to obtaining the baseline labs. No changes will be made to their diet, exercise pattern or in treatment for the DM. This will be done by a telephone conversation.\n\nVISIT 2 (Day 1): Subjects will report fasting to GCRC at 8 AM. Subjects will briefly meet with bionutritionist for 24 hour dietary recall and instructions to keep a food diary on day 2 and 3. Blood sample (50ml) will be collected for fasting glucose, insulin, lipid panel, Apo B, Apo A-1, CPK, Hb A1c, plasma and serum frozen for sterol analyses (by GC) and WBC separated for DNA extraction.\n\nThe subject will be asked to consume with a cholesterol tracer (Cholesterol D5). Subjects will be asked to consume the 8 ounces in entirety. They will be asked not to eat/drink anything (except water) until the lunch time. If 8 Ounces are inadequate for breakfast, subjects will be offered another 8 Oz serving of Carnation® Instant Breakfast in the same or different flavor. If the subject is lactose intolerant, Lactaid tablets will be offered to offset the effects of milk. If subjects are unable to consume milk (with or without Lactaid®) or allergic to soy bean oil, they will be ineligible to participate in the study. Subjects will be sent home with a urine jug to collect 24-hour urine on day 3.\n\nVISIT 3 (Day 4): Subject will bring the urine jug and food diary back for analysis and that same day will have blood (20ml) collected for evaluation of tracers. Food diary will be reviewed by the bionutritionist. Urine pregnancy test will be performed in women of child bearing age. Subjects will be started on either simvastatin or ezetimibe (we will alternate the subjects so that half the sample will initially be treated with simvastatin and half will be started on ezetimibe). The dose of Simvastatin (Merck) is 40 mg orally at nighttime for 6 weeks and the dose of ezetimibe (Schering-Plough) is 10 mg taken orally once a day. Subjects will be instructed on low-fat diet (therapeutic life style changes diet) recommended by American Heart Association by the bionutritionist.\n\nVISIT 4 (Day 46 ± 7 days): Subjects will report fasting to GCRC at 8 AM. The subject will consume Carnation® Instant Breakfast with a cholesterol tracer (Cholesterol D5). Subjects will be asked to maintain same dietary restriction as visit 2. Subjects will be sent home with a urine jug to collect 24-hour urine on day 3. Subjects will start food diary on day 47 and 48.\n\nVISIT 5 (Day 49 ± 7 days): Subject will bring the urine jug and food diary back for analysis and that same day will have blood (40ml) collected for evaluation of tracers, lipid panel, Apo A1, Apo B 100, ALT, CPK, plasma and serum stored for sterol analyses (by GC). Same day, weight, waist and hip circumference will be measured again. Food diary will be reviewed by bionutritionist. Subjects will be asked to bring back pill bottles also for pill count. Simvastatin or ezetimibe will be stopped for 4 weeks.\n\nVISIT 6 (Day 77 ± 7 days): Subjects will be asked to come fasting to GCRC at 8 AM. 15ml of blood will be collected to measure lipid panel, apo B100 and Apo A1, Hb A1C, and ALT levels. Urine pregnancy test will be performed in women of child bearing age. Subjects will be started on 10 mg of ezetimibe or 40 mg of simvastatin as mentioned above for next 6 weeks.\n\nVISIT 7 (Day 119 ± 7 days): Subjects will report fasting to GCRC at 8 AM. The subject will consume a Carnation® Instant Breakfast with cholesterol tracer (Cholesterol D5). Subjects will be asked to maintain same dietary restriction as visit 2. Subjects will be sent home with a urine jug to collect 24-hour urine on day 3.\n\nSubjects will start food diary on day 120 and 121\n\nVISIT 8 (Day 122 ± 7 days): Subject will bring the urine jug and food diary back for analysis and that same day will have blood (40 ml) collected for evaluation of tracers, lipid panel, Apo B100, Apo A1, Hb A1c, ALT, CPK, plasma and serum stored for sterol analyses (by GC). Weight, waist and hip circumference will be measured again. Food diary will be reviewed by bionutritionist. Ezetimibe or simvastatin therapy will be stopped. Subjects will be asked to resume their usual cholesterol lowering medications.\n\nEnding the Study:\n\nStudy will be ended when all the required participants are enrolled. We will also consider stopping the study when accumulated data suggests that risks exceed benefits of the study or if preliminary data suggests there is a clear advantage of treating a particular group with a certain agent."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus","Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus","Hypercholesterolemia"],"keywords":["Diabetes Mellitus","Hypercholesterolemia","Simvastatin","Ezetimibe."]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":57,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus, option 1","type":"OTHER","description":"Half the subjects will start with arm (i.e. every other subject in order)\n\n* Simvastatin 40 mg tablet by month daily for 6 weeks,\n* 4 weeks washout period\n\nHalf the subjects will start with arm (i.e. every other subject in order)\n\n* Ezetimibe 10 mg by month for 6 weeks\n* 4 weeks washout period\n* Simvastatin 40 mg tablet by month daily for 6 weeks","interventionNames":["Drug: simvastatin or ezetimibe"]},{"label":"Subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus option 1","type":"OTHER","description":"Half the subjects will start with arm (i.e. every other subject in order)\n\n* Simvastatin 40 mg tablet by month daily for 6 weeks,\n* 4 weeks washout period\n\nHalf the subjects will start with arm (i.e. every other subject in order)\n\n* Ezetimibe 10 mg by month for 6 weeks\n* 4 weeks washout period\n* Simvastatin 40 mg tablet by month daily for 6 weeks","interventionNames":["Drug: simvastatin or ezetimibe"]},{"label":"Subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus, option 2","type":"OTHER","description":"Half the subjects will start with arm (i.e. every other subject in order)\n\n* Ezetimibe 10 mg by month for 6 weeks,\n* 4 weeks washout period","interventionNames":["Drug: simvastatin or ezetimibe"]},{"label":"Subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus option 2","type":"OTHER","description":"Half the subjects will start with arm (i.e. every other subject in order) Ezetimibe 10 mg by month for 6 weeks,\n\n•4 weeks washout period","interventionNames":["Drug: simvastatin or ezetimibe"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"simvastatin or ezetimibe","description":"Subjects will be started on either simvastatin or ezetimibe (we will alternate the subjects so that half the sample will initially be treated with simvastatin and half will be started on ezetimibe).

Several biochemical determinations will be realized (p.e. marker of fat intake and marker of inflammation) The proposed intervention consists of a series of clinical visits and phone calls programmed with the aim to change the dietetic and physical activity habits of people. The Pizarra study (financed with other grants and realised with the same methodology) will be use as cohort control. Though the basic aim of the project is to achieve a reduction of the of diabetes incidence with a hygienic - sanitary intervention, the ambition of knowing the major number of possible factors that can participate in this process constitutes a complex project capable of analyzing the problem from diverse points of view. Endocrinologists (of two Andalusian hospitals), clinical biochemists, geneticists and dietitians they join in this project to approach an integral way the etiopathogeny of the diabetes type 2.","detailedDescription":"1. Intervention study population: Egabro Study. This study commenced in 2009 in Cabra, a town of 20,000 inhabitants located in the Subbética region of Cordoba Province (Spain). The study includes persons aged over 40 years.\n2. Control population: Pizarra Study. The Pizarra Study is in progress since 1995. The details of this study have been the subject of multiple publications (see CVs). The start of the Egabro Study coincided with the third evaluation of the Pizarra cohort, as well as the extension of the population base, which will now enable the whole population of Pizarra aged over 40 years to be studied.\n3. Design: A prospective cohort study with exposure to an intervention on hygiene and health habits:\n\nCohort A. Egabro Study:\n\nFirst phase: Cross-sectional prevalence study Second phase: Intensive intervention study in certain risk groups (Cohort study, with a control group)\n\nCohort B. Pizarra Study:\n\nFirst phase: Prevalence study (cross-sectional, extension of the initial cohort) Second phase: Follow-up of the cohort, to be used as a control group for the intervention study in the Egabro project 4. Subjects susceptible to the intervention:\n\n1. Persons who, after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), are identified as having the phenotype of Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) 2. Persons who, after an OGTT, are identified as having diabetes mellitus. 5. Sampling. Sample size The calculation of the sample size was done according to the recommendations of Carné X et al. (Carné X, et al. Medicina Clín (Barc), 1989; 92:72-73). The sample size was calculated for the main study endpoints based on the Pizarra study data with the aim of decrease the risk of having diabetes about 50% (alpha=0.05, power=90%). The minimum sample size is 479 subject in each cohort. To date, the investigators have enrolled 600 subject each cohort by random sampling.\n\n6. Intervention protocol:\n\nThe intervention being undertaken consists of a series of programmed clinical visits and telephone calls in order to change the dietary and lifestyle habits of the participants. Briefly:\n\nLevel 1 intervention General recommendations about a healthy diet and physical activity and referral to their general physician with a report of the study results in the event of detecting any risk factor or pathological finding. The procedure is the standard used to date in the Pizarra study and which will continue to be used in this cohort. Subjects with a normal OGTT in the Egabro Study will also be used.\n\nLevel 2 intervention\n\nThis will consist of an intensive intervention on dietary and physical activity habits as well as Level 1 recommendations. It will be carried out in all those subjects in the Egabro Study who have any alteration after the OGTT: IFG, IGT or previously unknown diabetes. All will be recommended to attend their family physician with a report of the results in order to receive the standard treatment in each case (Level 1 intervention). Additionally, an intervention protocol will be included based on office visits each 4 months during the first year, as well as monthly telephone calls during the first year. Each subject will also attend a group educational meeting each 6 months. At each visit they will be given a series of recommendations and their degree of adherence evaluated and the evolution of their weight checked The recommendations are designed to re-educate the subjects concerning their dietary and physical activity habits:\n\n7.Follow up: two year\n\nSPECIFIC METHODS in basal study and follow up:\n\nField work (basal and at the end of the first year and second year of the intervention (or observation of the control cohort):\n\n1. An OGTT will be given to all the participants who had an altered OGTT in the baseline study (200 subjects in the Egabro cohort + 200 subjects in the Pizarra cohort).\n2. Serum will be obtained fasting and after the OGTT.\n3. Records will be made of weight, height, waist and hip circumferences, skinfold thicknesses (suprailiac, subscapular, bicipital and tricipital) and blood pressure.\n4. Muscle strength will be estimated as measured by hand grip dynamometry\n5. A dietary questionnaire will be given (24 hour recall + frequency survey)\n6. An evaluation will be made of physical activity\n7. Questions will be asked about any sociodemographic variation and incidence of disease since the previous visit\n8. The data will be included in the general database of the project.\n\nBiochemical study (basal and at the end of the first year and second year of the intervention (or observation of the control cohort):\n\nDetermination of glucose, insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, ferritin, C-reactive protein, liver enzymes, urea, uric acid and creatinine in fasting serum and glucose and insulin in post OGTT serum, after one and two year of follow-up.\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\n\n1. The first visits have been done by two participating endocrinologists, one registered nurse and one nutritional technician expressly employed for the study (one team in each cohort).\n2. Informed consent was requested. Each of the participants completed a questionnaire with closed exhaustive questions. The physical examination was made in accordance with the methods recommended by the WHO (WHO Technical Report Series 854, Geneva 1995). Data were collected on weight, height and waist and hip circumferences of each participant in light clothing and without shoes using a calibrated standardized electronic scale, stadiometer and metric measure. The blood pressure was also taken, with a digital sphygmomanometer (Omron, Hem-703C). The dynamometry was done with the right hand recording three determinations.\n3. All the participants, except those who said they were diabetic or who had a capillary blood glucose \\>180 mg/dL, underwent an OGTT with 75 gr of glucose and venous extraction at baseline and after 2 hours, in accordance with the recommendations of the 1985 WHO technical report. The participants with known or reported diabetes were checked for the diagnosis of diabetes (from the clinical charts) and underwent just fasting blood extraction. Thirty minutes after the extraction the samples are centrifuged \"in situ\" using a portable centrifuge. The samples are then stored in aliquots and frozen in situ for 15 days before storing them definitively at _80ºC. Determinations are made of blood glucose, cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides using routine standardized techniques. The LDL cholesterol is calculated from the Friedewald equation, excluding those participants with triglycerides \\>400 mg/dL. The blood and serum samples are stored at -80ºC following the protocols of the National DNA Bank for metabolic diseases. The blood is used for genotyping (see below) and the serum for making biochemical and fatty acid measurements (gas chromatography of methyl derivatives) contemplated in the study.\n4. The diagnostic criteria for normality, IFG, IGT and type 2 diabetes mellitus used are those established by the 1999 WHO expert committee.\n5. The criteria used to define hypertension are those of the US Joint National Committee VI.\n6. To typify the weight of the group the body mass index (BMI) is used (BMI = weight in kg/height in m2) and the waist-to-hip ratio. For smoking, participants are considered to be smokers if they smoke or have quit smoking within the previous six months. A family history of type 2 diabetes is considered to be present if the participants report the disease in a first-degree relative (parents, siblings, children).\n7. Lipid abnormalities are identified by Brunzell criteria (Brunzell et al. Diabetes Care 2008).\n8. Nutritional evaluation: The nutritional questionnaire is designed to collect information about nutritional habits, frequencies and amounts of foods. The following tools are used.\n\n   8.1 Twenty-four hour recall survey: repeated at two different times of the year.\n\n   8.2 Food frequency questionnaire, following the recommendations of Willet (Nutritional Epidemiology. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1990). The questionnaires are given by experienced dietitians previously trained for this project.\n\n   8.3 The transformation to nutrients of the dietary information is done by computerized conversion according to Moreiras and Martín, modified by one of the researchers of this group using his own sources (Soriguer F. et al. European Journal Epidemiology 13:451-463,1997) as well as other nutrient tables (Mataix J. Universidad de Granada, 2003).\n\n   8.4 Scale of adherence to a Mediterranean diet based on the results of the questionnaires\n9. The evaluation of physical activity is done by questionnaires about frequency of activities\n\nANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS AND STATISTICAL STUDY. All the information derived from the Pizarra and the Egabro studies is collected in specially designed computerized databases. Statistical hypothesis contrast for the variables according to the previsions of the hypothesis elaborated in the design using parametric or non parametric tests according to the adjustment to normality. The strength of the associations in the crosssectional study will be measured by calculating the odds ratio from 2×2 tables or from coefficients of the logistic models when they adjust for possible confounding variables. To compare the incidence / prevention rates of metabolic disorders, the two cohorts will be standardized for age and sex and the relative risks will be calculated with their corresponding CI. The multivariate analysis will be done using Cox regression.\n\nLIMITATIONS: Bias in participation: being a study population, certain groups tend to participate more likely than others. It compensates also working on weekends and holidays to prevent working people participate less. The design is \"quasiexperimental\". The indication bias of the intervention program carried out will be adjusted using the propensity score method, which enables elimination of the indication bias and making the study closer, using techniques of pairing (\"nearest\" method) to the most similar situation to that of an experimental study, using probabilities predicted by the logistic models.\n\nLocations:\n\nLocal Diabetic Association of Cabra, Córdoba.

Important lifestyle behaviors, i.e. sleep, sedentary time (SB), and physical activity (PA) subdivided into light physical activity (LPA) and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), have shown an impact on T2DM disease-specific characteristics (e.g. glycemic control). However, these behaviors have often been investigated separately. Therefore, a recent shift in research emphasizes the importance of considering these behaviors as part of a 24-hour day.\n\nSince T2DM patients can benefit from an optimal 24-hour composition as part of a healthy lifestyle, it may be interesting to investigate the 24-hour movement composition among these T2DM patients over time. Moreover, exploring associations with different personal determinants, environmental determinants, and cardiometabolic markers will provide meaningful insights in developing recommendations and creating an intervention.","detailedDescription":"The present study aims (1) to conduct a longitudinal observational study over two years to explore 24-hour movement behavior composition patterns among T2DM patients in comparison with a healthy control group and (2) to examine associations between these movement behaviors and personal and environmental determinants, and cardiometabolic markers.

However, the access to dieticians in primary care is limited. While mHealth tools have been shown to improve diet and clinical management of patients with T2DM, there are currently no mobile health (mHealth) tools that are effective in improving diet and clinical management of T2DM in Sweden. The aim of this project is to study the effect of the FoodSwitch app, an mHealth intervention for patients with T2DM.","detailedDescription":"This randomized controlled trial will determine the effect of the FoodSwitch app for healthier food choices on HbA1c, blood lipids, renal function and low-grade inflammation in individuals with T2DM. The effect of the mHealth tool on HbA1c and cardiovascular risk factors, will be compared to standard dietary advice for patients with T2DM. Randomization will be performed in a 1:1 ratio to receive the FoodSwitch app intervention or control and stratified by age (\\<50 years/≥50 years), sex, and baseline insulin use (Yes/No). The intervention group will scan all their purchased packaged food with the FoodSwitch app for one week at 6 and 12, 18 and 26 weeks. The control group will photograph and upload images of their receipts or share digital shopping receipts for one week at 6 and 12, 18 and 26 weeks. All participants in both the intervention and control group will report symptoms, functions, and quality of life, as often as they like as well as at 6 and 12, 18 and 26 weeks. All participants will be mailed a blood and urine collection kit and instructed to use it and to self-measure waist circumference at the start of the study and at 26 weeks. The primary outcome (HbA1c) and secondary outcomes (blood measurements of total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol, eGFR, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, proteomics, and metabolomics; microalbuminuria; self-measured waist circumference; self-reported quality of life, 24-hour dietary recall, as well as other present symptoms; smartphone-obtained physical activity levels and patterns) will be evaluated at 26 weeks.

The comprehension of the mechanisms that link over nutrition to inflammation and innate immune response can be important to understand the relationship between insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus and endothelial dysfunction. It will be investigated: 1) the role of Toll Like Receptors (TLR)s in the pathophysiology of T2D and associated atherosclerosis; 2) the role of aspirin and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor/s in the production of TxA2 and F2-isoprostanes in T2D patients; 3)new biomarkers associated to Diabetes and atherosclerosis including markers of endothelial dysfunction and cytokines.\n\nIt will be analyzed in isolated platelets from normal controls and/or diabetic patients the production of TxA2, isoprostanes and pro-inflammatory/thrombotic cytokines using aspirin and NADPHoxidase inhibitors.","detailedDescription":"Study design: prospective, controlled, randomized study. All eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 manner to receive aspirin or placebo.\n\nIn each recruited subjects we will do:\n\n1. Anamnestic clinical information and Anthropometric measurements\n2. Electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and ultrasound assessment of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and flow-mediated dilatation (FMD)\n3. Ankle-Brachial Index measurement (ABI)\n4. blood samples from an antecubital vein after an overnight fast and urine samples at baseline, after 3 days and after 30 days of aspirin (100 mg/day) administration.\n\nLaboratory Methods: Blood samples will be immediately centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was collected and stored at -80°C until measurement. All measurements will be done blinded. Samples will be tested in duplicate, and those showing values above the standard curve will be re-tested with appropriate dilutions.Analysis of urinary and platelet isoprostane:Urinary PGF2α-III was measured by a previously described and validated EIA assay method. Ten millilitre urine were extracted on a C-18 SPE column; the purification was tested for recovery by adding a radioactive tracer (tritiated PGF2α-III) (Cayman chemical). The eluates were dried under nitrogen, recovered with 1ml of buffer, and assayed in a PGF2α-III specific EIA kit (Cayman chemical). Urinary PGF2α-III concentration was corrected for recovery and creatinine excretion and expressed as pg/mg of creatinine. PRP was then centrifuged 20 min at 800 g to concentrate platelets and the pellet was suspended in Tyrode buffer to obtain a final platelet concentration of 5x108/mL. PGF2α-III content was measured by a validated EIA assay method as previously described and expressed as pg/mg platelet protein."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus"],"keywords":["Diabetes","Isoprostanes","Thromboxane","Aspirin"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Aspirin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"100 mg/day for 30 days","interventionNames":["Drug: Aspirin"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"1 cp /day for 30 days","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Aspirin","description":"100 mg/day for 30 days","armGroupLabels":["Aspirin"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"1 cp day for 30 days","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Changes of isoprostanes after study drug administration.","description":"Mearuring levels of isoprostanes to understand if isoprostanes could play a crucial role in thrombus formation, independently from Aspirin mediated COX-1 inhibition, supporting their role in the phenomenon of the so call \"aspirin resistance\" in the setting of T2DM.","timeFrame":"3 and 30 days"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (defined according to the criteria of the American Diabetes Association)\n* Sign of a written informed consent to participate to the interventional study\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Liver disease\n* Serious renal disorders (serum creatinine \\>2.5 mg/dL)\n* History or evidence of previous major vascular events (myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, stroke)\n* History of major bleeding\n* Autoimmune diseases\n* Cancer or present or recent infections\n* Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, drugs interfering with cholesterol metabolism, or vitamin supplements or antiplatelet drugs in the previous 30 days","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Francesco Violi, Full Prof","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+39-06-4461933","email":"francesco.violi@uniroma1.it"},{"name":"Stefania Basili, Ass Prof","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+39-06-49974678","email":"stefania.basili@uniroma1.it"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Francesco Violi","affiliation":"Divisione di Prima Clinica Medica - Sapienza University of Rome","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Sapienza Università di Roma","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Rome","zip":"00161","country":"Italy","contacts":[{"name":"Francesco Violi, Full Prof","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+39-06-4461933","email":"francesco.violi@uniroma1.it"},{"name":"Stefania Basili, Ass Prof","role":"CONTACT","phone":"+39-06-49974678","email":"stefania.basili@uniroma1.it"},{"name":"Francesco Violi, full Prof","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":41.89193,"lon":12.51133}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"23770972","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Carnevale R, Iuliano L, Nocella C, Bartimoccia S, Trape S, Russo R, Gentile MC, Cangemi R, Loffredo L, Pignatelli P, Violi F; IPINET group.

Diabetes even appears to be the most important predictor of low kinetic fractures in men and women, and the risk of hip fracture in type 2 diabetics is increased by 40 to 50%, with often more serious consequences (post-operative complications, longer hospital stays, increased mortality rate).\n\nCurrently, the risk of fractures is estimated by the measure of areal bone mineral density (aBMD) and T-score. However, in diabetics aBMD is not decreased, and even paradoxically increased. Indeed, aBMD is 5-10% higher in type 2 diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic subjects, which suggests that the assessment of fracture risk in these patients is underestimated. The High Resolution peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HR-pQCT) 3D bone imaging technique has a resolution close to the size of the bone trabeculae. It is used to assess volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) and bone microarchitecture at the tibia and distal radius, and enables a better estimation of the fracture risk compared to the measurement of aBMD. Our hypothesis is that bone microarchitecture is altered in type 2 diabetic patients, explaining the increased risk of fracture in this population compared to non-diabetics.\n\nWe propose to set up a descriptive case control study, nestled in 3 cohorts of men and women (QUALYOR, OFELY and STRAMBO), to compare the bone micro-architecture measured by HR-pQCT at the level of the tibia and distal radius, in type 2 diabetics compared to non-diabetic subjects from the same cohorts."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Type 2 Diabetes"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":582,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with Type 2 diabetes","description":"Subjects from 3 cohorts (QUALYOR, OFELY, STRAMBO) presenting type 2 diabetes","interventionNames":["Other: Patients with Type 2 diabetes"]},{"label":"Control subjects without Type 2 diabetes","description":"Controls patients from 3 cohorts (QUALYOR, OFELY, STRAMBO) without type 2 diabetes","interventionNames":["Other: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Patients with Type 2 diabetes","description":"No intervention","armGroupLabels":["Patients with Type 2 diabetes"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Placebo","description":"Placebo comparator","armGroupLabels":["Control subjects without Type 2 diabetes"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The main outcome is the comparison of total volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) at the tibia and distal radius, in type 2 diabetics compared to non-diabetic subjects.","description":"The main outcome is the comparison of total volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) measured by HR-pQCT at the tibia and distal radius, in type 2 diabetics compared to non-diabetic subjects from 3 cohorts of men and women (QUALYOR, OFELY, STRAMBO).","timeFrame":"at inclusion for Qualyor patients.

The pivotal components of this approach include adapting, implementing, and evaluating the PLA-based intervention for the prevention and control of Type II diabetes. These components will be tailored to meet the specific needs of two different settings in Peshawar and Swabi, Pakistan.\n\nType II Diabetes Mellitus (TIIDM) is considered the fastest-growing health emergency, affecting 537 million adults worldwide. Global projections for the year 2045 suggest that a 12.2% rise in TIIDM is anticipated with an additional 11.4% rise for intermediate hyperglycemia (IHG) \\[1\\].

A full trial will be conducted in the rural areas of Peshawar and Swabi, Pakistan.\n\nIt is anticipated that with the use of evidence-based approaches, best practices, and meaningful community participation, PLA is expected to enhance social and behavioural determinants of health and subsequent outcomes. This will further pave the way for the control of other NCDs through a similar focused approach.","detailedDescription":"The PLA approach has been systematized into a community approach where groups meet together and follow a cycle of activities. This cycle involves problem identification, collaborative strategy planning, implementation, and participatory evaluation. To address community health issues, various strategies including photo voice, group discussions, and role-play have been widely utilized. By leveraging their life experiences, individuals are encouraged to actively participate in these activities, empowering them to identify problems and utilize their skills to develop effective solutions.\n\nScientific evidence has demonstrated PLA to be a cost-effective technique to increase maternal and neonatal survival in low-resource settings like India and Nepal. Moreover, it increased awareness about birth preparedness, improved newborn care practices, and enhanced male participation in maternal and newborn health.\n\nThis study will utilize a community group-based PLA approach to tackle TIIDM (adapted from D-Magic Bangladesh). A cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of PLA in addressing TIIDM and pre-diabetes in rural areas of Peshawar and Swabi, Pakistan. The PLA approach is instrumental in improving health outcomes and services by fostering collaborative community efforts and empowering the community. This collaborative approach fosters a sense of unity, inclusivity, and shared responsibility, ultimately contributing to improved health outcomes and the overall well-being of the community. However, despite its significant impact PLA has not been adapted or tested in settings elsewhere for the prevention and control of TIIDM.\n\nObjective:\n\n1. To culturally adapt PLA-based intervention (DMagic) for primary prevention and control of TIIDM in rural communities of Pakistan.\n2. To assess the effectiveness of culturally adapted PLA-based intervention (adapted from D-Magic trial Bangladesh) on the two-year cumulative incidence of TIIDM in high-risk individuals and the prevalence of IHG and TIIDM in rural settings.\n3.

In addition changes in gut peptides and gut permeability after implantation of a removable duodeno-jejunal bypass device to induce diabetes remission in obese subjects with sub-optimally controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus will be determined. Further changes in body weight and body composition, the change in global cardiovascular risk from baseline to 12 months, estimated using the UKPDS risk engine will be recorded.","detailedDescription":"Obesity and diabetes probably represent the most challenging threat to public health in the 21st century. Obesity has multiple deleterious effects on health, significantly increasing the risk of fatal and non-fatal diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Bariatric surgery is a well-established method for the treatment of morbid obesity and has increasingly been recognized as an effective, long-lasting treatment option for T2DM.\n\nRecently a potential, non-invasive alternative to bariatric surgery, a duodenal-jejunal bypass liner (EndoBarrierTM) has been introduced. It is an endoscopically implantable and removable device that prevents contact between partially digested nutrients and the proximal intestine. This device was shown to reduce body weight and to improve glycaemic control in subjects with diabetes. Small pilot studies suggested a change in incretin levels, similar to that observed after gastric surgery with an improvement of insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. To better understand and characterize the hormonal and/or metabolic effects after the implantation and removal of the EndoBarrierTM, this monocentric, prospective, trial is being performed.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to clarify the changes in gut peptides and gut permeability after implantation the EndoBarrierTM in obese subjects with sub-optimally controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additionally, the investigators aim to determine the changes in body weight and measure of adiposity, the change in global cardiovascular risk from baseline to 12 months as well as the changes in insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function over time."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Type 2

Patients of the participating physicians (nine in each group), were randomly selected and assigned to one of four groups (117 patients each): control, provider education, patient education, and provider/patient education.\n\nIntervention: Structured group education programmes were delivered to provider and/or people with type 2 diabetes by trained professionals; identical system interventions were applied to all four groups.\n\nMain outcome measures: Body mass index, blood pressure, fasting glucose, haemoglobin A1c levels, lipid profile, drug consumption, resource use, and patient well being (WHO-5 questionnaire and Lowe score), at baseline and up to 42 months at every 6 months intervals.","detailedDescription":"The study protocol was evaluated and approved by an external ethical committee; patients gave informed consent to participate in the study according with the guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonisation and WHO good clinical practice standards. The study design has been previously described in detail.30 Briefly, the investigators implemented a randomized 2x2 design to address the effectiveness of different education strategies involving the health provider and people with diabetes).\n\nSample size: for its determination in each of the four groups, the investigators considered the change in haemoglobin A1c (from baseline to the end of the study) as the primary outcome variable. This was done using a two-sided test at the 5% level of significance and 80% power using a paired t-test. The sample size was increased by 25% to account for non-independence and dropout, resulting in the number of providers and patients listed in table 1.\n\nEducational strategies The investigators used the Diabetes Training Course for Physicians and Diabetes Structured Education Courses for People with T2DM, whose characteristics and usefulness have been previously reported.\n\nData collection Patients' clinical, psychological, biochemical, therapeutic and economic data before and after PRODIACOR were recorded using the Physician Data Form, the Annual and Bi-annual Clinical Record Form and the Feedback Report Form. The investigators developed software that compares the first two mentioned forms and generates a Biannual Feedback Report for physicians and patients; it compares the values recorded for haemoglobin A1c, serum lipids and blood pressure, and the goal proposed for each parameter according to international standards. It also includes recommendations about appropriate treatment to achieve therapeutic goals.31 Additionally, the investigators used the Patient Questionnaire, based on the one previously used in the Diabetes Advantage Program (DAP) which includes questions about the disease, and the WHO-5 well-being questionnaire. Data collection was completed with the Personalized Checkbook, a tool initially developed for the PROPAT study, whose aim and content have been previously described. It serves to order procedures, consultations, laboratory tests, prescription of drugs and strips for glucose self-monitoring, to record and communicate results, and as a payment voucher for all those items.\n\nStudy and Data management The Local Coordinator (city of Corrientes) together with the Central Cordinating Center (CENEXA), oversaw the education courses and the overall trial and maintained periodic contact with the participating physicians. Performance of the physicians and their patients was monitored at regular intervals (6 months) during the whole study period. Every physician was visited twice a year by a physician monitor who assessed the quality of the data he has recorded.30 Participating physicians collect their own patients´ data, sent it to the Local Coordinator who controlled its completeness and forwarded to the Central Coordinating Centre.\n\nResource utilization and costs The data recorded include all direct medical items used by each of the patients ascribed to the programme, and were obtained from the checkbook and the utilization and cost records from each of the participating health coverage entities.\n\nUtilization was classified into five groups: i) hospitalizations, ii) drugs and supplies, iii) diagnostic tests, iv) special studies, and v) physician office visits. Drugs were identified by their generic and commercial name and their corresponding presentation. Their costs were assessed from retail prices published by Alfabeta.net and adjusted to July 2004 using the health chapter of local Consumer Price Index.\n\nEstimated drug costs and haemoglobin A1c reduction experienced by each treatment group were used to construct marginal figures of cost-consequence ratio. For this purpose, the investigators calculated such ratio figures for each experimental group, i.e., the investigators expressed the total drug cost associated to 1% haemoglobin A1c decrease to 10 mm Hg of systolic blood pressure or 10 mg/dL of triglyceride levels. The investigators did not currently estimate the costs of the educational interventions themselves, namely, all the physical and human resources involved in the management and administrative activities of the programme.\n\nStatistical analysis To estimate the effects of the different educational interventions tested, intention to treat analysis was used. Initial univariate differences among groups for quantitative data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA (Bonferroni post hoc test). Factorial ANOVA and two-way ANOVA models (Bonferroni post hoc test) were used to assess the differences among groups along the study. ANOVA was also used to explore initial vs. end-of-study differences among quantitative data. Differences among qualitative measures were explored by Chi-squared (Yates corrected). P values of less than 0.05 were considered as significant (two tailed). Missing data strategies applied to the primary endpoint were last observation carried forward and complete case analysis. Both strategies were compared to evaluate the impact of missing data on the efficacy analysis of the primary endpoint."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Type 2 Diabetes"],"keywords":["T2DM","Cardiovascular risk factors","Metabolic control","Well-being","Cost","Cost-consequence"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":468,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients and provider non educated","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"In this arm neither the patients nor the providers have attended the groupal education courses","interventionNames":["Other: Education"]},{"label":"Provider educated","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Provider attend the interactive group education, while patients do not.","interventionNames":["Other: Education"]},{"label":"Patients Educated","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients attend the interactive group education, while providers do not.","interventionNames":["Other: Education"]},{"label":"Providers/Patients Educated","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Provider and Patients both attend the interactive group education.","interventionNames":["Other: Education"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Education","description":"Structured group education programmes were delivered to provider and/or people with type 2 diabetes by trained professionals; identical system interventions were applied to all four groups.","armGroupLabels":["Patients Educated","Patients and provider non educated","Provider educated","Providers/Patients Educated"],"otherNames":["Diabetes Education"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"HbA1c","timeFrame":"42 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Quality of Care Indicators","description":"Body mass index, blood pressure, fasting glucose, lipid profile, drug consumption, resource use, and patient well being (WHO-5 questionnaire and Lowe score)","timeFrame":"42 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Adults Patients with type 2 diabetes\n* Being regularly attended at the doctors office during at least one year\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes\n* Advanced stage of chronics complications (End-stage-kidney disease)\n* Heart Failure.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Juan J Gagliardino, MD","affiliation":"CENEXA (UNLP-CONICET La Plata)","role":"STUDY_DIRECTOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"CENEXA (UNLP-CONICET La PLata)","city":"La Plata","state":"Buenos Aires","zip":"1900","country":"Argentina","geoPoint":{"lat":-34.92145,"lon":-57.95453}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"17331807","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Gagliardino JJ, Lapertosa S, Villagra M, Caporale JE, Oliver P, Gonzalez C, Siri F, Clark Ch Jr; PRODIACOR.

This figure is expected to rise to 629 million by the year 2045.1 90% of the diabetic population has type 2 diabetes. 2 As of 2018, more than 500 million individuals are residing with type 2 diabetes mellitus globally. 3 In Pakistan, the situation is similarly alarming. According to a recent survey, 16.98% of the Pakistani population has diabetes.4 The primary target of therapy in diabetes mellitus is optimum blood glucose control. In case of type 2 diabetes, this is achieved by a combination of oral hypoglycemic agents and injectable drugs with insulin as a last resort.\n\nA number of oral agents targeting various sites of action are available. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are newer class of drugs that have been introduced. They have a unique mechanism of action. By acting at the sodium glucose co-transporter, they block the reabsorption of glucose leading to an increase in urinary glucose excretion and lowering of plasma glucose.5 This action is completely independent of the beta cell function. There are several theoretical advantages to this approach. In addition to lowering blood glucose, the urinary glucose excretion results in loss of calories and weight reduction and the associated osmotic diuretic effect can aid in lowering blood pressures.6,7 Numerous studies have demonstrated a favorable risk benefit ratio of empagliflozin as monotherapy8 as well as add-on therapy to other hypoglycemic agents.9,10,11,12 They also have additional cardiovascular benefits with several studies documenting a reduction in mortality.13,14 Moreover, the sodium glucose co-transporters also demonstrated a reduction in the onset and worsening of nephropathy and preservation of renal function.15 This effect is not restricted to empagliflozin alone, as other drugs in the class have also demonstrated this benefit.16 Empagliflozin with its novel mechanism of action has its own set of side effects. Increased urinary glucose losses lead to a higher proportion of urinary tract infections and genital tract infections. This has been evidenced in various studies.17 The osmotic diuresis that benefits in lowering blood pressures at one end, also predisposes the patients to volume depletion.Empagliflozin, one of the three drugs from this class, approved by the FDA for treatment of type 2 diabetes. According to the recent ADA and the EASD guidelines, they have become an essential component of the algorithm recommended for managing type 2 diabetes.18 The recently published consensus statement by the South Asian Federation of Endocrine Societies has incorporated sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes as monotherapy in patients who are intolerant to or have any contraindication to metformin therapy. Additionally, drugs belonging to this class are also recommended as combination therapy with other oral hypoglycemic agents as well as insulin.19 Empagliflozin, however, has not been studied in the Pakistani population as yet. The main aim of this study is to establish the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin in optimum control of blood sugar in type 2 diabetes. This is the first study of its kind being performed in the Pakistani population."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Type II Diabetes Mellitus"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":244,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Empagliflozin","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Empagliflozin"]},{"label":"Usual Care Group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Usual care group"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Empagliflozin","description":"Group A: Empagliflozin 10/25 mg once daily with or without antidiabetic drugs","armGroupLabels":["Empagliflozin"],"otherNames":["Group A"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Usual care group","description":"Group B: usual care group but without Empagliflozin with adjustment of therapy as the standard of care","armGroupLabels":["Usual Care Group"],"otherNames":["Group B"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of participants reported adverse events","description":"Number of participants reported adverse events such as Hypoglycemic events, Hypotension, Dehydration, Urinary tract infection, Diabetic Ketoacidosis, Fungal infection or any other","timeFrame":"24 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Frequency of participants achieved HbA1c level <7%","description":"Frequency of participants achieved HbA1c level \\<7%","timeFrame":"24 weeks"},{"measure":"Frequency of participants achieved FBS level within normal range","description":"Frequency of participants achieved FBS level within normal range","timeFrame":"24 weeks"}],"otherOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of participants reduces weight during the therapy","description":"Number of participants reduces weight during the therapy or mean reduction in weight overtime","timeFrame":"24 weeks"},{"measure":"Number of participants reduces BMI level as per WHO Asian classification during the therapy","description":"Number of participants reduces BMI or mean reduction in BMI overtime","timeFrame":"24 weeks"},{"measure":"Number of participants reduces Waist circumference during the therapy","description":"Number of participants reduces Waist circumference or mean reduction in BMI overtime","timeFrame":"24 weeks"},{"measure":"Number of participants changes systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure during the therapy","description":"Number of participants reduces systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure or mean reduction in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure overtime","timeFrame":"24 weeks"},{"measure":"Number of participants changes LDL level and HDL Level during the therapy","description":"Number of participants reduces LDL level and HDL Level or mean reduction in LDL level and HDL Level overtime","timeFrame":"24 weeks"},{"measure":"Mean score of diabetes mellitus quality of life","description":"The instrument provides an overall scale score, as well as two subscale scores for 1) satisfaction with treatment, 2) adherence with Self Care Regimen. 15 Items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale and are of two general formats.One format asks about the frequency of negative impact of diabetes itself or of the diabetes treatment and provides response options from 1 (never) to 5 (all the time).

Hypertension is a major risk factor for CVD in patients with type-II-DM with a major increase in diabetes-related death as a result. Controlled hypertension as well as uncontrolled- and resistant hypertension is more common in patients with type-II-DM than in the general population and are major contributors to CVD and cardiovascular mortality.\n\nResistant hypertension is defined as BP above 130 mmHg systolic and / or 80 mmHg diastolic despite treatment with 3 antihypertensive agents or more, of which one should be a diuretic, or controlled BP on four antihypertensive agents or more.\n\nThe NHANES study estimated the prevalence of hypertension in patients with type-II-DM to 71% and showed that among those with type-II-DM and hypertension only 31% had controlled BP. It is furthermore estimated that resistant that hypertension is present in up to 30% of a hypertensive population and the ALLHAT trial found that 50% of hypertensives needed treatment with three or more antihypertensive agents.\n\nType-II-DM promotes both small and large artery disease, whereas hypertension promotes primarily large artery disease. As such type-II-DM and hypertension together may influence the entire vascular system. Type-II-DM is strongly associated with development of heart failure and atherosclerosis and it is therefore important to investigate parameters that reflect arterial stiffness (AS), left ventricular function and degree of atherosclerosis.\n\nAS is an age dependent process, where the arterial wall degenerate and elastic fibers are replaced by collagen fibers. The process is accelerated by cardiac risk factors and increased AS can be regarded as both an individual risk factor and a marker reflecting atherosclerosis.\n\nAS can be estimated by pulse wave analysis (PWA) including pulse wave velocity (PWV).\n\nAs blood is pumped out of the heart, a pulse wave is created. The pulse wave propagates along the vessels and is reflected from the arterial wall at sites of increased impedance. In healthy elastic arteries the reflected wave reaches the aorta during diastole resulting in increased coronary perfusion. In stiff arteries the reflected wave propagates faster and reaches the aorta during systole before closure of the aortic valve, thereby increasing pulse pressure, systolic pressure and reducing diastolic pressure and thereby coronary perfusion.\n\nAugmentation Index (AIx) measured using PWA is related to ischemic heart disease (IHD) risk factors, among other hypertension and diabetes, and is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with IHD. It is therefore important to examine the relationship between BP and AS, as it may characterize the patients with uncontrolled and resistant hypertension.\n\nA consequence of increased AS is left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and a common echocardiographic finding in patients with hypertension, type-II-DM and LVH, is diastolic dysfunction. This is often seen before the onset of systolic dysfunction and any symptoms of CVD.\n\nCoronary artery calcium (CAC) score is closely related to atherosclerosis and is a number reflecting the degree and extent of calcium deposits in the walls of the coronary arteries, as demonstrated by cardiac computed tomography. CAC score represents overall plaque burden and is also an independent predictor of cardiovascular events (CVE) and cardiovascular death in asymptomatic patients. In patients with type-II-DM the extent of CAC score is similar to that of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Measurement of CAC score can be used as advanced risk assessment. As CAC score is high in patients with cardiac risk factors it is possible that CAC score is reduced when minimizing cardiac risk factors.\n\nThe relationship between BP, AS and left ventricular function score may provide further methods of risk stratification and new strategies for treatment of uncontrolled and resistant hypertension in patients with type-II-DM.\n\nHypothesis\n\n1. Uncontrolled and resistant hypertension is present in more than 50% of consecutive patients with type-II-DM in an out-patient clinic.\n2. Increased AS, diastolic dysfunction and high CAC score are more common in patients with type-II-DM with uncontrolled or resistant hypertension than in patients with controlled BP.\n3. AS, diastolic function and CAC are improved with increased control of BP.\n\nTo test these hypotheses we wish to conduct two studies:\n\n1. A descriptive study in which the prevalence of uncontrolled and resistant hypertension in consecutive out-patients with type-II-DM is assessed.\n2. Assessment of AS, diastolic function and CAC in patients with type-II-DM with uncontrolled and resistant hypertension and the changes in these parameters during intensified treatment. This is compared to patients with controlled BP."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Resistant Hypertension","NIDDM"],"keywords":["Resistant hypertension","Type-II-Diabetes Mellitus","Arterial stiffness","Ventricular function"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Only serum and plasma samples are used and saved for later analysis."},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":180,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Pulse wave velocity","timeFrame":"one year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Myocardial contractility","timeFrame":"One year"},{"measure":"Pulse wave analysis","timeFrame":"One year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* 18-80 years, informed consent, hypertension, type-II-diabetes mellitus\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Non-compliance, s-creatinin above 200, AFli","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients from diabetic outpatient clinic","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Trine K Sønder, Cand.med.","affiliation":"Department of Medical Research, Svendborg Hospital","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Department of Medical Research, Svendborg Hospital","city":"Svendborg","zip":"5700","country":"Denmark","geoPoint":{"lat":55.05982,"lon":10.60677}}]}},"annotationSection":{"annotationModule":{"unpostedAnnotation":{"unpostedResponsibleParty":"Trine Koustrup Soender, Medical Doctor, Svendborg Hospital","unpostedEvents":[{"type":"RELEASE","date":"2013-12-02"},{"type":"RESET","date":"2014-01-16"}]}}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2025-04-17","submissionTracking":{"estimatedResultsFirstSubmitDate":"2013-12-02","submissionInfos":[{"releaseDate":"2013-12-02","resetDate":"2014-01-16"}]}},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D006973","term":"Hypertension"},{"id":"D003920","term":"Diabetes Mellitus"},{"id":"D003924","term":"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D014652","term":"Vascular Diseases"},{"id":"D002318","term":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"id":"D044882","term":"Glucose Metabolism Disorders"},{"id":"D008659","term":"Metabolic Diseases"},{"id":"D004700","term":"Endocrine System Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M7115","name":"Diabetes Mellitus","asFound":"Diabetes Mellitus","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M7119","name":"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2","asFound":"Type II Diabetes Mellitus","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10024","name":"Hypertension","asFound":"Hypertension","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M17400","name":"Vascular Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11639","name":"Metabolic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M25403","name":"Glucose Metabolism Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7862","name":"Endocrine System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC18","name":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC19","name":"Gland and Hormone Related Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC14","name":"Heart and Blood Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false},

Post-partum pregnancy is ideal for behavioural modification and adopting a healthy lifestyle. Using the continous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor and an exercise tracker will promote self-motivation and awareness by positive reinforcement and behavioural changes to improve diet, control body weight and increase physical activity in this group of post-partum women who are at high risk for developing Type II Diabetes.\n2. The use of the continous glycose monitoring (CGM) sensor and exercise tracker will motivate women to modify their dietary food intake and physical activity over time, reducing their cardiovascular risk factors for developing metabolic syndrome by lowering their baseline blood pressure, BMI, reducing their waist circumference and body fat mass, glycaemic levels and fasting lipids within the targeted healthy range.\n3. There will be an increase in the quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained based on improvements in HbA1C and other proximal outcomes at the end of the trial.","detailedDescription":"The increased incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) resulting from increased insulin resistance has become a major health concern. GDM affects 5-10% of pregnant women in Europe, while the prevalence in Asian populations is significantly higher at approximately 15-20%. There is a need for early postpartum intervention strategies beginning soon after birth, but yet there are limited of such intervention studies conducted in Asia.\n\nThis is a randomized controlled trial and hospital-based study. A total of 300 post-partum women who attended KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) for antenatal consultation and were diagnosed with GDM using International association of diabetes and pregnancy study groups (IADPSG) guidelines at KKH, with a BMI range from 20-40, and physically fit to participate in moderate intensity walking will be approached for prospective recruitment. These subjects will be followed-up to determine if they will have normal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results at 6 weeks postpartum. If all the inclusion criteria is met, these women will be recruited into the study.\n\nThe recruited women will be randomly allocated to the intervention or control group. Those placed in the intervention group, which will also be known as the Wearable Care Group, will receive both a continous glucose monitoring (CGM) and an exercise tracker which will be a FitBit watch. Those placed in the control group, which will also be known as the Scheduled Care Group will receive standard medical care.\n\nParticipants randomized to both the control (Scheduled Care Group) and the intervention group (Wearable Care Group) will be followed up in the specialist outpatient clinics with a total of 7 visits for up to 4 years. Various testing will be carried out at relevant time points.\n\nData will be collected through questionnaires and clinical measurements. The questionnaires include socio-economic factors, a quality of life questionnaire, maternal diet, medical histories, lifestyle factors, health status, and home environment. Bio-physical measurements will be obtained from anthropometric measurements of participants, human biological materials such as blood, are collected from the participants at their follow-up time points with the I-HIPS study upon their consent."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Gestational Diabetes","Glucose Metabolism Disorders","Metabolic Disease"],"keywords":["gestational diabetes","post-partum intervention","Body composition"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Participants randomized to both the control (Scheduled Care Group) and the intervention group (Wearable Care Group).","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Wearable Care Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group will receive both a continous glucose monitoring sensor and an exercise tracker to be worn for at least 2 weeks at each study visit timepoint.","interventionNames":["Device: Wearable Care Group"]},{"label":"Scheduled Care Group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"This group will receive standard medical care with dietary and nutritional advice alone."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Wearable Care Group","description":"Continous glucose monitoring sensor: Study participants wear the sensor on the back of either right or left upper arm for up to 14 days.

It is hypothesized that this behavioral family intervention will be feasible to implement with teens with type 2 diabetes and will have positive effects on treatment adherence, health outcomes like weight status and metabolic control, and psychological outcomes.","detailedDescription":"The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) in youth is increasing dramatically with the rise in obesity in the U.S. and worldwide. DM2 in youth, as with adults, is clearly linked to modifiable risk factors such as obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and poor diet. Youth with DM2 are at increased risk for medical complications such as cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, and neuropathy, as well as psychological problems such as depression, anxiety, poor self-esteem, eating disorders, and poor coping and problem solving. Although there are studies demonstrating that family-based lifestyle and psychological interventions are successful in reducing obesity in youth and in improving metabolic control and adherence in youth with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1), very little has been published on potential lifestyle or psychological treatments for youth with DM2. Studies have shown that Behavioral Family Systems Therapy (BFST) has been effective in improving metabolic control, adherence, family communication, and problem solving in youth with DM1. This intervention could be effective in treating youth with DM2, as many of the skills necessary for good metabolic control, health outcomes, treatment adherence, and psychological adjustment are similar in both populations. This application proposes a randomized, controlled pilot trial of BFST-DM2, an individual psychological intervention tailored to meet the needs of teens with DM2. BFST will be adapted to make this intervention more feasible and relevant with minority and low-income populations and also to focus on weight management, exercise, and nutrition. The BFST-DM2 intervention includes 12 (90-minute) sessions over 6 months. Areas targeted for improvement will include metabolic control, weight/body mass index, treatment adherence, family lifestyle choices (activity, diet), family communication, and problem solving. One of the main aims of this pilot study is to gather exploratory information on the effectiveness of the BFST-DM2 intervention on measures of health outcomes, medical adherence, lifestyle changes, and family problem-solving and communication skills. In addition, it is an aim to estimate treatment effect size to determine the sample size needed to power a larger multi-site trial of the BFST-DM2 intervention. Other aims include determining factors associated with feasibility (recruitment, retention, participation, generalizability) as well as to modify the intervention to be culturally sensitive and to be more relevant to the individual needs of the DM2 adolescent population. The BFST-DM2 intervention will be compared with standard medical therapy on measures of health outcomes (metabolic control, body mass index, weight, waist circumference, body fat) physical activity (accelerometer), nutritional intake, treatment adherence, psychological adjustment (self-esteem, quality of life), family communication, and problem solving. The researchers will analyze predictors of treatment outcome and the treatment effects at the immediate post-treatment interval (6 months from baseline). Health outcomes and medical adherence data also will be collected 12 months from baseline to determine maintenance of treatment effects over time."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2","Childhood Obesity"],"keywords":["type 2 diabetes in adolescents","obesity in adolescents","behavioral family systems therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Psychological intervention","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Families randomized to the intervention group will receive 12 sessions of Behavioral Family Systems Therapy for Teens with type 2 diabetes (BFST-DM2) over 6 months.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: BFST for Teens with Type 2 Diabetes"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"The participants assigned to the control group will receive their standard medical care for diabetes."}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"BFST for Teens with Type 2 Diabetes","description":"12 (90 minute sessions) over 6 months of Behavioral Family Systems Therapy (BFST), delivered by a Licensed clinical social worker.

It is hypothesized that this behavioral family intervention will be feasible to implement with teens with type 2 diabetes and will have positive effects on treatment adherence, health outcomes like weight status and metabolic control, and psychological outcomes.","detailedDescription":"The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) in youth is increasing dramatically with the rise in obesity in the U.S. and worldwide. DM2 in youth, as with adults, is clearly linked to modifiable risk factors such as obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and poor diet. Youth with DM2 are at increased risk for medical complications such as cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, and neuropathy, as well as psychological problems such as depression, anxiety, poor self-esteem, eating disorders, and poor coping and problem solving. Although there are studies demonstrating that family-based lifestyle and psychological interventions are successful in reducing obesity in youth and in improving metabolic control and adherence in youth with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1), very little has been published on potential lifestyle or psychological treatments for youth with DM2. Studies have shown that Behavioral Family Systems Therapy (BFST) has been effective in improving metabolic control, adherence, family communication, and problem solving in youth with DM1. This intervention could be effective in treating youth with DM2, as many of the skills necessary for good metabolic control, health outcomes, treatment adherence, and psychological adjustment are similar in both populations. This application proposes a randomized, controlled pilot trial of BFST-DM2, an individual psychological intervention tailored to meet the needs of teens with DM2. BFST will be adapted to make this intervention more feasible and relevant with minority and low-income populations and also to focus on weight management, exercise, and nutrition. The BFST-DM2 intervention includes 12 (90-minute) sessions over 6 months. Areas targeted for improvement will include metabolic control, weight/body mass index, treatment adherence, family lifestyle choices (activity, diet), family communication, and problem solving. One of the main aims of this pilot study is to gather exploratory information on the effectiveness of the BFST-DM2 intervention on measures of health outcomes, medical adherence, lifestyle changes, and family problem-solving and communication skills. In addition, it is an aim to estimate treatment effect size to determine the sample size needed to power a larger multi-site trial of the BFST-DM2 intervention. Other aims include determining factors associated with feasibility (recruitment, retention, participation, generalizability) as well as to modify the intervention to be culturally sensitive and to be more relevant to the individual needs of the DM2 adolescent population. The BFST-DM2 intervention will be compared with standard medical therapy on measures of health outcomes (metabolic control, body mass index, weight, waist circumference, body fat) physical activity (accelerometer), nutritional intake, treatment adherence, psychological adjustment (self-esteem, quality of life), family communication, and problem solving. The researchers will analyze predictors of treatment outcome and the treatment effects at the immediate post-treatment interval (6 months from baseline). Health outcomes and medical adherence data also will be collected 12 months from baseline to determine maintenance of treatment effects over time."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2","Childhood Obesity"],"keywords":["type 2 diabetes in adolescents","obesity in adolescents","behavioral family systems therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"BFST for Teens with Type 2 Diabetes","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Psychological intervention: Families randomized to the intervention group will receive 12 sessions of Behavioral Family Systems Therapy for Teens with type 2 diabetes (BFST-DM2) over 6 months.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: BFST for Teens with Type 2 Diabetes"]},{"label":"Control group (Standard Care)","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"The participants assigned to the control group will receive their standard medical care for diabetes."}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"BFST for Teens with Type 2 Diabetes","description":"BFST for Teens with Type 2 Diabetes: 12 (90 minute sessions) over 6 months of Behavioral Family Systems Therapy (BFST), delivered by a Licensed clinical social worker.

The study population comprises adults who have been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test above 8% in the past year. All members of the study population are treated at primary care clinics under the auspices of the Utah Beacon Community Program, which aims to improve health through use of health information technology. We will compare outcomes in two groups within this population: patients with DM who enroll in Care4Life (in addition to receiving standard care) to patients with DM who receive standard care from their physician. We will compare these groups both within the clinic and at an aggregated, overall level.\n\nThis study relies on the use of information and communications technology (ICT) in supporting patient-empowerment strategies. Features of successful diabetes care programs for improving adherence to standards of care, such as the use of diabetes self-management education, checklists that mirror guidelines, and automated reminders are well suited to delivery using an interactive mobile health platform.\n\nResearch Questions\n\nThis study will evaluate the efficacy of the Care4Life mHealth program by:\n\n1. Evaluating if a short message service via cell phone texting (SMS) protocol will lead to improvements in clinical, utilization and satisfaction outcomes for patients with DM compared to patient who receive standard care.\n2. Evaluating if an SMS protocol can be readily adopted by an adult population in both urban and rural areas with a time-consuming chronic illness.\n\nTargeted outcomes include:\n\n1. Improved measures of diabetes control, demonstrated as HbA1c percentage levels ≤ 8%; improved blood pressure (BP) control, demonstrated as BP ≤ 140/90 millimeters mercury (mm Hg); and lower body mass index (BMI) among users of the SMS-based tool.\n2. Improved knowledge of self-care and disease management practices among adult patients with diabetes treated in Beacon clinics in the Salt Lake Metropolitan Statistical Area (Salt Lake, Tooele, and Summit counties).\n3. Dissemination of results and proof of concept with the broader healthcare community in Utah.\n\nThe mobile centric diabetes support service at the center of our study is Voxiva's Care4Life platform, which is an interactive mobile application designed to educate participants, encourage behavior change and promote adherence to their prescribed DM treatment protocol. It includes a series of SMS-based tools that have been developed in collaboration with the Instituto Carso de la Salud, located in Mexico. The service sends content relevant to the target participants and their standard treatment protocol. Care4Life delivers an individually tailored diabetes education and management plan based on data that are collected from patients at enrollment and added to the participant's personal health profile.\n\nThe SMS protocol draws on the experience of a number of interventions that have been independently studied and shown to improve health outcomes. Care4Life functionality consists of the following components: (1) a diabetes diary that can be used to develop a history of glucose levels and trigger alerts and feedback based on the participant's results; (2) health education with content tailored to the participant's health profile; (3) medication adherence reminders and monitoring; (4) medical appointment reminders; (5) a database that allows a participant to record and monitor her/his weight, BMI, blood pressure and laboratory results; and (6) a health portal that allows a participant to review his/her data, obtain advice and guidance based on the information entered, and manage his/her preferences."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Type II Diabetes Mellitus"],"keywords":["SMS","text","text messages","text messaging","diabetes","diabetes mellitus","type II diabetes","type II diabetes mellitus","type 2 diabetes","type 2 diabetes mellitus","Beacon"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Care4Life","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Text message and online interactive component to help patients with self-management.","interventionNames":["Other: Participation in Care4Life"]},{"label":"Standard of Care","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Patients enrolled in this arm will receive their normal standard of care from their physician for treatment of type II Diabetes Mellitus."}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Participation in Care4Life","description":"Text message service to aid patients with self-management of type II Diabetes Mellitus.

Individuals with T2DM experience many psychosocial conditions leading to anxiety and depression as well as physical and functional effects. It has been reported that the fear of diabetic complications plays a vital role in depression, while individuals with diabetes with anxiety are more prone to depression. In addition, increased treatment cost burden has been reported among the psychological factors contributing to anxiety and depression in individuals with DM. One study reported that fatigue is commonly associated with increased anxiety, depression, and sleep problems in individuals with DM. A sedentary lifestyle in these individuals is noteworthy and has also been shown to be a contributing factor to depression.\n\nIn addition to improving diabetic complications due to the disease, reducing depressive states and improving the psychosocial status of individuals may positively affect diabetes and reduce the symptoms and complications of T2DM. It has also been reported that increasing the self-efficacy of individuals with diabetes may positively impact the treatment. Based on this information, it is clear that there is a need for physical and psychosocial evaluation of individuals with T2DM in disease management. Therefore, determination of the biopsychosocial effects of individuals with T2DM in improving disease-specific findings and quality of life of individuals with T2DM to reflect positively on disease management processes is necessary for holistic management in treating these individuals. However, studies in this field are insufficient. This study aimed to compare individuals with and without T2DM biopsychosocial characteristics.\n\nThe BETY-Biopsychosocial Questionnaire, which assesses the biopsychosocial status of individuals with rheumatism, has no validity in individuals with T2DM. Since the patient population and other scales to be used are common, it was considered to carry out the validity, reliability, and responsiveness study of this scale within the scope of this study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus"],"keywords":["Diabetes Mellitus","biopsychosocial model","BETY-BQ","validity and reliability","anxiety","depression"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Individuals diagnosed with diabetes mellitus","description":"Individuals with diabetes mellitus admitted to the internal medicine outpatient clinic of a university hospital.

In the case of patients with type 2 diabetic mellitus (DM) on treatment with oral hypoglycemic agent (OHA), patients are instructed to temporarily discontinue treatment on the day prior to surgery. This advice is based on the concern for intraoperative and postoperative hypoglycemia in this group of patients. Metformin , a dimethylbiguanide, is widely used as an oral antihyperglycemic drug in the long term treatment of type 2 DM. This instruction to withhold treatment may be imprudent given that metformin by virtue of its mechanism of action does not cause hypoglycemia. Another concern often cited as a reason to withhold metformin is the reported adverse effect of lactic acidosis. However, a recent metanalysis by the Cochrane group found no cases of fatal or nonfatal lactic acidosis in 70,490 patient-years of metformin use, or in 55,451 patient-years for those not on metformin. Furthermore, discontinuing OHA treatment can result in disruption of established glycemic control and intraoperative and postoperative hyperglycemia all of which can be deleterious to the patient.\n\nWe hypothesize that uninterrupted treatment with OHA in type 2 DM patients undergoing ambulatory surgery will not result in intraoperative and postoperative hypoglycemia (defined as blood glucose \\< 60mg/dl) compared to patients withholding OHA treatment on the day of surgery.","detailedDescription":"Patients with established diagnosis of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) who are on OHA monotherapy or combination OHA and are scheduled to undergo ambulatory surgery will be identified. Informed consent will be obtained from 160 consecutive study participants. Patients will be randomized into 2 groups - OHA treatment on day of surgery (Metformin continue) (H1 group, n= 80) and patients not receiving OHA on day of surgery (OHA discontinue) (H0, n=80) as prescribed by their provider. All patients will be processed through the anesthesia preoperative clinic and instructions regarding preoperative medication handling will be provided to study participants by the investigator. The instructions will be reinforced by the clinic nursing staff in the usual fashion.\n\nOn the morning of the surgical procedure, the investigator will verify that medication administration instructions provided to the study participant was adhered to. The patient will be checked-in into the ambulatory surgery suite and usual surgical preparatory procedures followed. Pre-anesthesia capillary blood glucose measurement will be performed and recorded in the pre-surgical area.\n\nAnesthesia will be induced and maintained in the usual fashion. Intraoperative capillary blood glucose levels will be checked and recorded.The investigator will ensure that glucose containing maintenance intravascular fluids are avoided throughout the anesthesia and surgery unless specifically indicated for treatment. All patients will be awakened and extubated at the end of surgery and transferred to the post anesthesia recovery (PAR) area as appropriate. Capillary blood glucose will be measured after arrival in the PAR. The capillary glucose tests obtained in this study is part of established and standard care and will be paid for by the patient."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Type 2"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":160,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Oral hypoglycemic agent continue","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Metformin continue on the day of surgery","interventionNames":["Drug: Metformin continue"]},{"label":"Oral hypoglycemic agent discontinue","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Metformin discontinue on the day of surgery","interventionNames":["Drug: Metformin discontinue"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Metformin continue","description":"Oral hypoglycemic agent continue on the day of ambulatory surgery","armGroupLabels":["Oral hypoglycemic agent continue"],"otherNames":["Metformin"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Metformin discontinue","description":"Oral hypoglycemic agent discontinue on the day of ambulatory surgery","armGroupLabels":["Oral hypoglycemic agent discontinue"],"otherNames":["Metformin"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Postoperative blood glucose level","description":"Postoperative blood glucose level","timeFrame":"Within 1 hour arrival of the Postanesthesia Care Unit (PACU)"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Men and women 18-80 years old\n* Established diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus\n* Undergoing ambulatory surgery.\n* Receiving OHA treatment for diabetes .\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Treatment of insulin monotherapy\n* Treatment with combination of oral hypoglycemic agents such as Thiazolidinediones-Repaglimide (Prandin), Rosiglitazone (Avandia), Pioglitazone (Actos).\n* Renal Insufficiency with Serum Creatinine \\> 2mg/dl\n* Decompensated congestive heart failure decompensated congestive heart failure","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"30044293","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Gasanova I, Meng J, Minhajuddin A, Melikman E, Alexander JC, Joshi GP.

The investigators intend to correlate increases in insulin signaling pathway activity following pioglitazone therapy with improvements in nitric oxide synthase expression in skeletal muscle. In addition, the investigators will evaluate vascular responses and in vivo nitric oxide release during administration of acetylcholine and nitroprusside in patients with type 2 diabetes. Enhanced knowledge of the molecular mechanisms responsible for endothelial dysfunction, an early abnormality in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, is critical before novel therapies to arrest or delay the appearance of cardiovascular complications in diabetes can be developed.\n\nThe investigators intend to recruit fifty type 2 diabetic patients treated with diet alone or diet plus sulfonylureas or meglitinides and add Pioglitazone (45 mg), an insulin sensitizer, for 6 months. In addition to assessment of clinical and metabolic parameters, insulin sensitivity and brachial artery and skin microcirculatory responses to acetylcholine and nitroprusside in combination with simultaneous determination of nitric oxide release will be documented before, 3 and 6 months after Pioglitazone therapy is initiated. Circulating levels of markers of endothelial damage (VCAM, ICAM, selectins), inflammation (C-reactive protein and interleukins), increased coagulability (PAI-1) as well as lipids and apolipoproteins will measured during the study. Skeletal muscle biopsies will be performed during the euglycemic insulin clamp before and 6 months after therapy for measurements of NO synthase activity and key elements of the insulin signal transduction pathway involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism (IRS-1, PI-3 kinase, PI-3 kinase associated with IRS-1 and the mitogenesis MAP-kinase.\n\nType 2 diabetes confers a substantial increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease. This is believed to be due, in part, to endothelial dysfunction, which correlates closely with impaired vascular responsiveness. Our study will clarify further the extent to which resistance to insulin action and impaired nitric oxide release from endothelial cells are interrelated. We also expect to demonstrate that insulin sensitizers (pioglitazone) can help to restore normal endothelial function, and ultimately prevent/delay the appearance of vascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes.","detailedDescription":"Specific Aims\n\nTo test the global hypothesis that increases in insulin signaling through either PI-3-kinase or MAP kinase pathways correlate with improvements in NO production or NOS expression in skeletal muscle following pioglitazone therapy, we will determine whether 6 months of Pioglitazone therapy:\n\ni. Increases the activities of muscle NO synthase, IRS-1, PI-3 kinase, PI3-kinase associated with IRS-1 and/or MAP-kinase ii. Improves brachial arterial endothelial function In addition, we will determine whether 6 months of pioglitazone therapy improves abnormal cardiovascular disease risk factors in type 2 diabetic patients by documenting the effects of the drug on plasma lipoprotein profile and on circulating levels of markers of hypercoagulability, inflammatory and endothelial damage.\n\nExperimental Plan Subjects. Adult type 2 diabetic individuals ranging from 18-65 yrs, with BMI between 24 and 37 kg/m2 and mean hemoglobin A1c levels equal to 6.5 and 9.0% will be studied. A total of 50 subjects will be recruited. There are over 8,000 type 2 diabetic patients under treatment at the TDI with a total of approximately 90,000 visits per year registered in the year 2000. As the main source of diabetes care and education to a population of predominantly Hispanic Americans, the TDI also is responsible for periodic screening in the community. Thus, we do not anticipate any problems in recruiting 50 subjects required for the present study. All patients will be normotensive, free of significant medical problems other than diabetes, and either on diet alone or diet plus sulfonylurea (or meglitinides) therapy. Subjects who have received or are receiving treatment with a thiazolidinedione (TZD) will be excluded. We previously have shown that sulfonyureas have no direct insulin sensitizing effect.\n\nResearch Design. General Approach. An open-label prospective clinical trial including 50 type 2 diabetic patients (25 diet-treated and 25 treated with diet plus sulfonylurea) will have pioglitazone, 45 mg daily; added to their therapeutic regimen. All patients will be closely monitored and, in addition to periodic contacts and clinical visits, metabolic and vascular parameters will be assessed at the beginning and after 3 and 6 months of therapy. Euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp with muscle biopsies will be performed at the beginning and after 6 months of treatment.\n\nSubject Recruitment. Potential volunteers will be invited for a screening visit (Visit 1) during which subjects will be instructed in English (with Spanish translation when appropriate) about the nature of the study, eligibility criteria and required commitments, as well as the potential risks and benefits anticipated for each individual and for the community in general. Written informed consent for participation in the clinical trial from individuals thought to be eligible to participate will be obtained at Visit 1.\n\nAt Visit 1 a complete medical history (including a list of current medications, reproductive status and menstrual history for females), physical examination (including height and weight), and vital signs will be obtained. Three consecutive blood pressure measurements will be performed in the sitting position using an automated arm cuff and only individuals with a blood pressure less than 140/90 mmHg will be considered eligible. A urinalysis will be performed and blood will be drawn after an overnight fast for measurement of complete blood count (hematocrit, white cells and platelets), plasma glucose, free T4 and TSH; SMA 20, lipid profile; hemoglobin A1c levels (HbA1C); free fatty acids, insulin and C-peptide concentrations and for a pregnancy test (females only). An EKG also will be performed. All diabetic patients who are deemed healthy and meet eligibility criteria (see below) based upon physical exam, medical history and screening laboratory tests will be invited to participate in the study.\n\nSubjects must meet all of the following criteria: 1) male or female 18-65 years of age; 2) type 2 diabetes based on the American Diabetes Association criteria; 3) HbA1c = 6.5-9.0% while on diet alone or diet plus sulfonylurea (or meglitinides) therapy; 4) no history of thiazolidinediones, insulin, ACE inhibitor or AII-receptor blockade therapy; 5) taking no medications known to affect glycemic control or endothelial function, unless the medication has been stable for at least 3 months; 6) blood pressure equal or below 140/90 mmHg; 7) not pregnant and willing to take appropriate contraceptive measures if capable of becoming pregnant; 8) serum creatinine below 1.7 mg/dl in female and 1.8 mg/dl in males; 9) ALT or AST less than 2 times the upper limit of normal for the laboratory and absence of clinical signs or symptoms of liver disease; 10) hematocrit \\> 34% in females and \\>35% in males; 11) normal thyroid function; 12) no evidence of coronary heart disease (by history or EKG) or moderate to severe congestive heart failure (NY Heart Association Cardiac Class III or IV); 13) no history or the presence of any clinically significant or unstable medical condition that makes the subject unlikely to complete the study in the opinion of the PI; and 14) absence of any condition or situations which would preclude adherence and completion of the protocol; 15) the ability to give voluntary informed consent. All clinical laboratory analyses for this trial will be performed at the central laboratory at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. All research analytical determinations will be performed in the laboratories of the Diabetes Division. Eligible subjects will return one week after Visit 1 for a second visit (Visit 2), a subject number will be assigned, and a nutritional assessment by a dietitian will be performed. A morning urine specimen will be collected for the determination of microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio. Patients also will have baseline determinations of circulating plasminogen activator inhibitor PAI-1, endothelin-1, VCAM, ECAM, p-selectin and e-selectin (markers of endothelial damage), C-reactive protein and interleukins (markers of inflammation); PAI-1 (marker o hypercoagulable state); plasma lipids (total HDL/LDL cholesterol and triglycerides), as well as LDL and HDL particle size, and apolipoproteins A1, B and C-III. All personal data, anthropometric measurements (height, weight, waist-to-hip ratio), dietary history, vital signs and clinical findings will be recorded in a confidential master file.\n\nEuglycemic Insulin Clamp with Muscle Biopsies. The degree of insulin resistance will be estimated with the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique (23) using an insulin infusion rate (80 mU/m2.min), as previously described (24). Briefly, one week after completion of the screening visit 2 (Visit 3), patients will report to the Clinical Research Unit at 8:00 AM after a 10-12 hour overnight fast. Catheters will be inserted into a peripheral vein (for infusion of all test substances) and into a retrograde hand vein (for blood sampling), which will be placed in a heated box (750 C). At time t = -120 minutes, a percutaneous biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle will be performed under local anesthesia as previously described (25). The subject then will be allowed to rest in bed for 60 minutes. At time t = -30 min to 0 min baseline blood samples will be obtained. At time = 0 min, insulin will be infused at 80 mU/m2.min for 180 minutes to raise the plasma insulin concentration to approximately 120 µU/ml to examine peripheral tissue (muscle) sensitivity to insulin. During the insulin clamp, a small amount of blood (0.5 ml) is withdrawn every 5 minutes from the arterialized venous blood (heated box technique) to determine plasma glucose concentration. When the plasma glucose concentration declines to 100 mg/dl a variable infusion of 20% dextrose is appropriately adjusted to maintain the plasma glucose concentration constant at this level (±5%). The rate of exogenous glucose infusion will be averaged during the last 60 minutes to provide a quantitative measure of insulin-mediated (primarily muscle) total glucose disposal. Insulin infusion will be stopped and the study will be terminated at t = 180 minutes. Patients will be observed for an additional 90 minutes after consuming a meal and they will be allowed to leave after plasma glucose is stable.\n\nVascular Studies. Subjects will be asked to return to the Clinical Research Unit one week after the euglycemic insulin clamp for vascular studies (Visit 4). Change in forearm blood flow following brachial artery infusion of acetylcholine (endothelial NO-dependent) and sodium nitroprusside (endothelial-independent) will be used to assess the arterial vasodilatory response to physiological stimuli. All test substances will be infused into the non-dominant arm. After local skin anesthesia with lidocaine, a 20-gauge needle attached to an arterial line (Arrow International, Erding, Germany) will be used to cannulate the brachial artery. A pressurized 0.9% saline solution bag will be connected to the arterial line, and a constant drip will be started at t = -60 min to keep the arterial line patent throughout the study. Subjects will then be allowed to rest for 60 minutes. At time t = -5 min, five consecutive measurements of forearm blood flow will be performed using a mercury strain gauge plethysmography (Hokanson Plethysmograph, Model EC4, Hokanson, Bellevue, WA), combined with a rapid cuff inflator. Test substances will be infused according to a variation of the original design of Bergholm et al, as follows. After completion of baseline measurements, an intra-brachial infusion of sodium nitroprusside at 3 microg/min will be started and continued for 12 minutes (the last 6 minutes are used to establish the local vascular effect of sodium nitroprusside). At time t = 12 min, the infusion rate of sodium nitroprusside is increased to 10 microg/min and the infusion continued for an additional 6 minutes. At time t = 18 min, the sodium nitroprusside infusion is stopped and 2 ml of blood is withdrawn to clear the arterial line. Saline is then infused for 30 minutes and at time t = 48 min, an intra-brachial infusion of acetylcholine at a constant rate of 15 microg/min is started and continued for 8 minutes (the last 6 minutes are used to establish the local vascular effect of acetylcholine). At time t = 54 min, the infusion rate of acetylcholine is doubled to 30 microg/min and the infusion continued for and additional 6 minutes. Forearm blood flow is measured five consecutive times during the last 3 minutes of each intra-brachial infusion period, i.e., at time t = 9-12 min and t = 15-18 min, respectively during the low and high nitroprusside dose, and at time t = 51-54 min and t = 57-60 min, respectively during the low and high acetylcholine dose. At time t= 60 min, the acetylcholine infusion is stopped and the study terminated. At the end of the experiment the arterial line is removed and compression to the area applied for 10 minutes. The radial pulse is verified every 5 minutes during the 30-min period after the experiment is terminated, before subjects are allowed to leave. Subjects will be contacted within 24 hrs and 1week after completion of the study to ascertain that there have been no complications.\n\nUpon completion of baseline metabolic and vascular studies patients will be started on pioglitazone, 30 mg per day (Visit 6). Patients will be asked to continue with their previous medical regimen and will be followed by the PI/nursing team at the Texas Diabetes Institute. All participants will be contacted weekly by phone to ascertain that there are no adverse events during the initiation period of 4 weeks, at which time the dose of pioglitazone will be increased to 45 mg per day. All patients will be required to return for office visits at 6 weeks intervals during the entire 6 months of the study (Visits 7-10). All available records of capillary blood glucose, adverse events and other major events will be collected and added to a confidential file under the patients' assigned number. Office visits every six weeks are intended to review patients' interim medical history to document adverse events, to emphasize adherence to the medical regimen, to obtain blood for laboratory determinations, and record vital signs, body weight, neurologic and fundoscopic findings. Blood and urine measurements similar to those in Visit 2 also will be obtained. Metabolic and vascular studies similar to those described above (Visits 3,4,5) before the initiation of pioglitazone therapy will be performed again at 3 and 6 months (Visits 8 and 10) and insulin clamps with muscle biopsies will be repeated at the end of the 6 month period (Visit 10). Patients will be discontinued from the study program for any of the following reasons: 1) the principal investigator decides that the subject should be withdrawn, either because of serious adverse events or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities; 2) the subject requests that he/she be withdrawn; 3) the subject becomes pregnant during the study; and 4) the subject is non-compliant with study guidelines, recommendations, and for the treatment regimen. Early termination at any time will be accompanied by collection of data as outlined in Visit 10. Any patient who is withdrawn from the study will be followed for as long as necessary to establish a stable therapeutic program.\n\nLaboratory Tests. Measurements of fasting plasma glucose (Beckman Glucose Analyzer), HbA1c (32) insulin (33) and C-peptide (34) by radioimmunoassay, and free fatty acids by HPLC (35) will be performed in the principal investigator's laboratory at the Texas Diabetes Institute, as previously described. Assays for VCAM and ICAM (3), p-Selectin and s-Selectin (4), PAI-1 and endothelin-1 (36), and plasma lipids by MRS (37) and apolipoproteins (38) will be performed in the laboratories of the Diabetes Division at the University of Texas Health Science Center. Measurements of IRS-1 thyrosine phosphorylation, PI-3 kinase activity and association of PI-3 kinase with IRS-1 also will be performed in the Diabetes Division laboratory.\n\nSample Size and Data Analysis Methods. We will perform correlation analyses to examine the relationships between the increment in skin and forearm blood flow following acetylcholine infusion and the improvements in plasma hemoglobin A1c levels and whole body insulin sensitivity before and after pioglitazone therapy using ANOVA with repeated measures over time. We anticipate that pioglitazone treatment will improve glycemic control and tissue insulin sensitivity and that the improvements in hemoglobin A1c and insulin action will be closely related to improvements in acetylcholine-stimulated increments in skin and forearm blood flow. Changes in insulin sensitivity (insulin clamp data), insulin signaling pathways activity, nitric oxide production in vivo, endothelial function, FPG and HbA1c will be compared. Further, we anticipate that plasma levels of endothelial damage markers (ICAM/VCAM), p-Selectin, s-Selectin and PAI-1 and inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and interleukins), which are elevated in diabetic patients, will be reduced following pioglitazone, and that the reduction will correlate with the improvements in skin and muscle endothelial function. We also expect to observe an improvement in the plasma lipid profile, especially triglycerides and free fatty acids after pioglitazone treatment. Similar correlations between improved endothelial-independent blood flow (nitroprusside-stimulated) following pioglitazone treatment and enhanced insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, nitric oxide production and insulin signaling pathways will also be performed. We expect that improved insulin sensitivity (insulin clamp) and increased NO production in vivo following pioglitazone treatment will be closely related to enhanced IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and total IRS-1 associated PI-3 kinase activity, which we previously have shown to be markedly impaired in type 2 diabetic individuals (39). In contrast, we expect that the MAP-kinase (mitogenic) pathway, which regulates vascular smooth muscle cell growth/proliferation and which we have shown to be normal or upregulated in type 2 diabetics, may be inhibited following pioglitazone treatment. It would be of great pathogenic significance if reduction in the MAP kinase activity correlated with the improved endothelial function following pioglitazone therapy.\n\nThe sample size calculation was based upon the changes in forearm blood flow in response to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside in normal and diabetic subjects during preliminary studies and from previously published studies by Caballero et al (10). The pooled standard deviation for changes from baseline to endpoint in forearm blood flow (ml/100gr per min) in our laboratory is 1.20. In order to detect with 90% power a difference in forearm blood flow in response to these physiologic agents before and after 6 months of pioglitazone therapy, 40 completed patients are required. Assuming a dropout rate of approximately 20%, 50 diabetic patients must be recruited to obtain 40 completers. Based on the laser Doppler skin blood flow measurements, we have an 80% chance of showing an improvement of \\~50% in skin blood in response to physiologic stimuli (from 65% to 100%) following pioglitazone therapy. Thus, we will have more than sufficient diabetic individuals to detect statistically significant changes in skin and muscle blood flow."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":39,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Pioglitazone","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Fifty type 2 diabetic patients (25 diet-treated and 25 treated with diet plus sulfonylurea) will have pioglitazone, 45 mg daily; added to their therapeutic regimen.

However, the contribution of COVID-19 to hyperglycemia and its effect on glycemic parameters are uncertain. However, it is important to investigate homocysteine and lipid profile levels, respectively, and free radical levels known to be effective in the development of cardiovascular disease and diabetes due to oxidative stress, which can provide information about the identification and diagnosis of cardiovascular complications in the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, as the decrease in physical activity levels of individuals in the COVID-19 pandemic may cause possible secondary complications such as an increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease, determining the physical activity levels of individuals and encouraging them to physical activity is another important parameter to minimize the negative effects of the process. Patients who applied to Izmir Bakircay University Cigli Training and Research Hospital (Cigli Regional Education Hospital) and hospitalized in the COVID-19 service and healthy controls are planning to include in this study. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 will be included in Group I (n: 20), patients diagnosed with both Type II Diabetes Mellitus and COVID-19 will be included in Group II (n: 20) and healthy controls will be included in Group III (n:20). Hemoglobin A1c levels, lipid profiles, homocysteine, free radical levels and physical activity levels will be compared between groups. In addition, the change in the relevant variables before and after COVID-19 treatment will be determined by in-group comparisons in Group I and Group II. This study, which has a prospective and randomized controlled research plan, is planned to be carried out between January and February 2021. Research data will be obtained from blood samples taken from participants. In addition, data on physical activity levels will be collected through a questionnaire. After analyzing the data obtained from the research with appropriate statistical methods, the data will be evaluated.","detailedDescription":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) results in significantly higher morbidity and mortality in patients with concomitant diseases such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension.\n\nGlycemic management is of much more interest for both diabetes and COVID-19 patients, as diabetes has been reported to be associated with the poor prognosis of COVID-19. There is evidence that better glycemic control in COVID-19 patients is closely related to improved clinical outcomes. However, whether COVID-19 contributes to hyperglycemia is confusing. It remains unclear regarding the impact of COVID-19 infection on glycemic parameters, including blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).\n\nLipid profile assessment is an important tool that helps diagnose cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, the stability of the samples is crucial for the analysis of total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG).Stability is the ability of analyte concentrations to be minimally affected within an acceptable range over a period of time.\n\nHigh plasma homocysteine levels significantly increase the incidence of vascular damage in both small and large vessels. Concentrations above the 90th percentile are associated with an increased risk of degenerative and atherosclerotic processes in the coronary, cerebral and peripheral circulatory systems. Although homocysteine is an effective cardiovascular risk biomarker and is critical for cardiovascular complications in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, studies on this parameter have not focused much on laboratory markers useful for clinical evaluation of COVID-19.\n\nFree radicals are continuously formed at the active site of enzymes as intermediates in enzymatic reactions occurring during cell metabolism. Reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen, known as intermediates, sometimes leach from the active site of enzymes and accidentally interact with molecular oxygen and form free oxygen radicals.Lipids, proteins, enzymes, carbohydrates, and DNA can be damaged due to oxidative stress, random breaks and bonds in DNA chains may occur as a result of damage to membranes, damage to enzymes and structural proteins may result in cell death, and these phenomena may result in cancer, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and It constitutes the molecular basis in the development of autoimmune disorders.\n\nThe general recommendation for thinking that an adult is physically active is to achieve at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous vigorous activity per week, or an equivalent combination of both, and involving sedentary behavior, energy expenditure ≤ 1.5 metabolic equivalent (MET), while lying down, leaning, It is defined as any waking behavior practiced while sitting or standing. As the disease spreads all over the world, healthy people are asked to stay at home for a long time. As a result, COVID-19 has radically changed the determinants of both behaviors (individual, interpersonal, environmental, regional or national policies and global). Accordingly, it can be said that regular and joint activities decrease due to isolation and limitations, especially in the first weeks when the population has limited chances to find alternatives to keep active even at home, and reducing sedentary behavior during closure poses a significant challenge. Because of this situation, physical activity in the home environment is strongly encouraged by public health advocates to prevent the potential harmful effects of protective lifestyle regulations due to COVID-19 and to prevent the restrictions from causing physical inactivity.\n\nThe main aim of this study is to compare hemoglobin A1c levels, lipid profiles, homocysteine, oxidative stress parameters and physical activity levels in patients with COVID-19 and patients with both COVID-19 and Type II diabetes via healthy adults. The second aim is to compare the initial data obtained following the hospitalization of COVID-19 patients and patients with both COVID-19 and Type II diabetes, with the latest data obtained after treatment and before discharge."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Covid19","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"],"keywords":["Hemoglobin A1c","Lipid profiles","Homocystein","Oxidative stress parameters","Physical activity level","Covid19 (SARS-CoV-2)","Type II Diabetes Mellitus"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"COVID-19 group (Group I)","description":"Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 will be in this group.

Pregnant individuals with GDM have higher rates of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, cesarean delivery, and maternal mortality as compared to those without GDM. While GDM frequently resolves after delivery, up to 70% of patients will develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) later in life10 and one third will develop subsequent diabetes or impaired glucose metabolism at the time of postpartum screening.\n\nWhile postpartum screening is recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) between 4-12 weeks postpartum for all patients with GDM in pregnancy, nearly 40% of patients do not attend a postpartum visit. Attendance is even lower among populations with limited resources, contributing to health disparities.\n\nTo address this issue, immediate in-hospital postpartum glucose tolerance testing has been evaluated and found to yield diagnostic values comparable to postpartum screening with the advantage of \\~100% adherence. However, 2 challenges remain: currently there is a lack of widespread clinical implementation of in-hospital immediate postpartum diabetes screening.\n\nTherefore, the overall goal of this proposal is to randomize patients to early screening during their postpartum hospitalization versus at their 6 week postpartum visit (current standard of care)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Gestational Diabetes","Type 2 Diabetes"],"keywords":["diabetes"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SCREENING","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":116,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Early Postpartum GDM Screening","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects who are randomly assigned to this condition will be screened for GDM with the recommended 2-hour glucose tolerance test during their postpartum hospitalization.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Glucose tolerance test (2 hour)"]},{"label":"Standard of Care Postpartum Screening","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Subjects randomized to the comparison condition will receive the usual standard of care.

Patients with T2DM have an increased risk of developing diastolic dysfunction. Using CMR, the investigators wish to measure left ventricle peak filling rate and passive atrial emptying fraction as a measure of cardiac diastolic function.

Additional outcome measures will include: weight, fasting plasma glucose, fasting serum insulin, postprandial plasma glucose and serum insulin following a test meal consistent with the assigned diet, serum fructosamine, fasting serum lipids, stool samples for gut microbiome analysis, and surveys to assess quality of life, including the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire. Compliance outcomes will include: urine nitrogen to creatinine ratio, survey data, three-day food diaries, and unannounced 24-hour diet recalls.","detailedDescription":"Thirty-eight adult men and women with DM2 will be recruited from the University of Minnesota and surrounding communities, and will be randomized to treatment with the LoBAG diet or a control diet. Following a consent and screening visit, there will be 5 additional study visits over a 12-week diet intervention period. Instruction in the assigned diet will be provided by a research dietitian at the beginning of the 12-week period, and reinforced at subsequent visits throughout the study. Participants will be asked to purchase food, prepare food, and consume the assigned diet in their own homes. They will be asked to keep activity level constant and to continue medications for diabetes (metformin or no medication) without change during the intervention. The primary outcome, HgbA1c, and secondary outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and following diet intervention. Study visits will occur at baseline (visits 1 and 2), week 1 (visit 3), week 6 (visit 4), week 9 (visit 5) and week 12 (final study visit). In addition to scheduled study visits the research team will contact participants every other week by telephone to address any issues that arise, with the purpose of increasing compliance and retention. Participants will be contacted once in weeks 9-12 for a 24-hour diet recall collected by the Nutrition Coordinating Center at the University of Minnesota.

(2) elucidate the mechanisms by which surgically induced weight loss reduces over time the risk of CVD in morbidly obsess subjects with T2DM.\n\nStudy'subjects will be enrolled from obese individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The study includes two groups, subjects undergoing gastric bypass surgery and a control group not undergoing weight loss surgery. A total of 60 subjects (30 in each group) will be recruited.\n\nBasal, 6 and 12 months assessments will include: insulin sensitivity determination, cardiovascular function by echo doppler, and DEXA scan.\n\nThis study involves risk-level II procedures, however, the risks inherent to the gastric bypass surgery are not considered study-derived because subjects are enrolled from individuals that have already decided to have this surgery. We will determine protein expression profiles of inflammation-related adipokines in the subcutaneous and intra-abdominal adipose tissues of morbidly obese subjects with T2DM before and after surgically induced weight loss.","detailedDescription":"Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are more likely to die from cardiovascular diseases (CVD) than people without diabetes. Furthermore, Patients with diabetes have not benefited from the advances in the management of CVD and/or its risk factors that have resulted in a decrease in mortality for CVD patients without diabetes. Short-term studies have demonstrated that weight loss in over weight or obese subjects with T2DM is associated with decreased insulin resistance, substantial improvements in glycemic and lipoprotein profile, and reduction in blood pressure. However, Long-term data substantiating that these improvements can be maintained are limited. Obesity, and susceptibility to weight gain, is a chronic condition. Continuous care is required to avoid weight regain especially after intensive weigh loss. Morbidly obese patients with body mass index (BMI) over 35 kg/m2 have significant difficulties maintaining weight loss adequate to resolve obesity-related medical conditions by changes in lifestyle or pharmacologic strategies. Currently, surgical treatment of morbid obesity, termed bariatric surgery, appears to be the only modality that results in significant and sustained weight loss along with reversal of diabetes and improvements in cholesterol biosynthesis, and lipoprotein metabolism in morbidly obese patients. Given these observations, we question if patients with T2DM who undergo gastric bypass surgery will significantly reduce levels of abnormalities in vascular structure and function that are central to the development of atherosclerosis. In specific aim 1, we will determine whether surgically induced weight loss decreases the risk of CVD in morbidly obese subjects with T2DM. . In specific aim 2, we will elucidate the mechanisms by which surgically induced weight loss reduces over time the risk of CVD in morbidly obsess subjects with T2DM. The proposed study is a prospective cohort clinic trial aimed to evaluate changes over time in cardiovascular structure and function of morbidly obese subjects with T2DM undergoing gastric bypass surgery compared to a matched control group who do not undergo gastric bypass surgery. The results of the proposed study will provide the foundation for a new clinic strategy aimed to prevent the development of CVD in obese patients with T2DM. Furthermore, it will serve as the baseline for future large scale longitudinal studies based on aggregate occurrence of severe cardiovascular events."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Obesity","Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus"],"keywords":["Obese","Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus","Gastric Bypass surgery","Risk of cardiovascular diseases"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"BASIC_SCIENCE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":84,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Gastric Bypass Surgery","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Gastric Bypass Surgery consists of a laparoscopic approach and includes the creation of an isolated 10-15-ml proximal gastric pouch, a retro-colic, retro-gastric Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy with linear stapler technique, a 100-cm Roux-limb, a 30-cm biliopancreatic limb, and a stapled end-side enteroenterostomy.","interventionNames":["Procedure: gastric bypass surgery"]},{"label":"Diabetes Support and Education","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Diabetes Support and Eduction.

In recent years, Pakistan has witnessed a significant increase in the prevalence of diabetes, making it a major public health concern. To address this growing problem, conducting clinical trials on diabetes in Pakistan is of utmost importance. Clinical trials play a crucial role in advancing medical knowledge, improving patient care, and finding effective treatments for diabetes.\n\nThis research aims to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Unani formulation Dolabi in treating type II diabetes mellitus. The study consists of two phases: a pre-clinical phase, which involves acute and subacute oral toxicity testing on animal models, and a clinical phase, which includes a single-blind, single-arm, multicenter, phase II clinical trial conducted at Shifa ul Mulk Memorial Hospital-Hamdard University and Haidery Herbal Care-North Nazimabad to evaluate its clinical efficacy.\n\nDiabetes management plays a vital role in effectively controlling the disease and minimizing its complications. Lifestyle management plays significant role in managing blood glucose levels in all age and gender segments. Medications are prescribed to regulate blood glucose levels when lifestyle changes alone are insufficient. Regular monitoring of blood sugar levels, along with other important parameters like blood pressure and cholesterol, helps individuals with diabetes to track their progress and make necessary adjustments to their treatment plans.\n\nDolabi is a time tested formulation of HLWP and it is being used clinically for more than 05 years at Hamdard Matabs all around Pakistan and clinically found satisfactory. The current study is designed in accordance with ICH GCP E6 protocols as approved by WHO and DRAP. It will enable us to present this safer and locally produced combination for the large community suffering with this condition in improving their lives."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus","Type 2 DM"],"keywords":["Diabetes Mellitus","T2DM","Metabolic disease","Insulin Resistance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Effect of Dolabi on DM II","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: Dolabi"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Dolabi","description":"herbal remedy for DM II","armGroupLabels":["Effect of Dolabi on DM II"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Blood Sugars","description":"Fasting Blood sugars at baseline and the end of treatment will be assess in (mg/dl).","timeFrame":"12 weeks"},{"measure":"HbA1C (Glycosylated Hemoglobin)","description":"Monitoring of HbA1C at baseline and at the end of treatment. the values of HbA1C will be assess in percentage (%).","timeFrame":"12 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects having Type II Diabetes Mellitus.\n* Subjects having raised FBS above 120 mg/dl and HbA1C level 6.7 or above.\n* Subjects over 30 years of age.\n* Subjects agree to use study medicine throughout the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects suffering from chronic liver diseases and kidney failure.\n* Subjects currently taking any hypoglycemic agent(s).\n* Subjects suffering from any type of cancer and any other comorbid condition.\n* Subjects having history of adverse drug reaction.\n* Pregnant and Lactating mother.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"30 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"locations":[{"facility":"Shifa Ul Mulk Memorial Hospital-Hamdard University","city":"Karachi","state":"Sindh","zip":"74600","country":"Pakistan","geoPoint":{"lat":24.8608,"lon":67.0104}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2025-04-17"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D003920","term":"Diabetes Mellitus"},{"id":"D003924","term":"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D044882","term":"Glucose Metabolism Disorders"},{"id":"D008659","term":"Metabolic Diseases"},{"id":"D004700","term":"Endocrine System Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M7115","name":"Diabetes Mellitus","asFound":"Diabetes Mellitus","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M7119","name":"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2","asFound":"Diabetes Mellitus Type II","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11639","name":"Metabolic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M10370","name":"Insulin Resistance","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M25403","name":"Glucose Metabolism Disorders","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7862","name":"Endocrine System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC18","name":"Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC19","name":"Gland and Hormone Related Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"}]},"interventionBrowseModule":{"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M10365","name":"Insulin","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M173166","name":"Insulin, Globin Zinc","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"Hypo","name":"Hypoglycemic Agents"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Drugs and Chemicals"}]}},"hasResults":false},

It may be due to impaired insulin secretion, resistance to peripheral actions of insulin, or both . Chronic hyperglycemia in synergy with the other metabolic aberrations in patients with diabetes mellitus can cause damage to various organ systems, leading to the development of disabling and life-threatening health complications, most prominent of which are microvascular (retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) and macrovascular complications leading to a 2-fold to 4-fold increased risk of cardiovascular diseases Mg2+ deficiency is usually identified by the measurement of serum Mg2+ concentration. Hypomagnesemia is defined by a serum Mg2+ concentration \\< 0.75 mmol/L, but a deficiency due to low dietary intake in otherwise healthy people is uncommon. Although overt signs of clinical Mg2+ deficiency are not routinely recognized in the healthy population, relatively low Mg2+ intake and/or Mg2+ status have been shown to be associated with chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, T2DM, osteoporosis, pulmonary disease, depression, migraine headaches, inflammation, and cancer"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"cases group","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Magnesium"]},{"label":"control group","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Magnesium"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Magnesium","description":"The aim of the study is to evaluate serum Mg level in type 2 DM patients.","armGroupLabels":["cases group","control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"magnesium perecentage","description":"evaluate serum Mg level in type 2 DM patients.","timeFrame":"1 year"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* • Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus according to WHO criteria.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* • Renal failure patients.\n\n  * Type I DM patients.\n  * Acute pancreatitis.\n  * Hyperthyroidism.\n  * Hyperparathyroidism.\n  * Malignancies.\n  * Patients on loop/thiazide diuretics.\n  * Patients on Mg supplement.\n  * Patients on Mg containing antacids.\n  * Any other conditions causing low Mg levels were excluded from the study.","sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"30 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus according to WHO criteria.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"hassnaa M kamel, resident","role":"CONTACT","phone":"01009700227","email":"hasnaamohamed@med.sohage.edu.eg"},{"name":"Elham o Hamd, professor","role":"CONTACT","phone":"01063090309"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Sohag university Hospital","city":"Sohag","country":"Egypt","contacts":[{"name":"Magdy M Amin, professor","role":"CONTACT"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":26.55695,"lon":31.69478}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"33466568","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Zheng L, Zhu X, Yang K, Zhu M, Farooqi AA, Kang D, Sun M, Xu Y, Lin X, Feng Y, Liang F, Zhang F, Linhardt RJ.

They were advised intensive life style modification which was reinforced at each follow-up visit. In addition they were prescribed extended release metformin (XR) in a gradually increasing tolerable dose, starting with 0.5g twice a day after meals. In addition, hypertension and dyslipidemia, when present, were treated with appropriate recommended drugs. Those who completed a satisfactory regular follow-up for at least 12 months or more were then analyzed for changes in their anthropometric measurements and glycemic control.","detailedDescription":"From 1st February 2006 till 31st December 2008, 800 cases of diabetes mellitus who attended the diabetes clinic constituted the subjects for the present study. Majority of the subjects were from the state of Uttar Pradesh (UP). UP is the fifth largest state of India, Lucknow being the capital of UP. The area of UP is 238,566 Km². Population of UP as per census of 2001 was 166,197,921 (Census of India, www.censusindia.net). Informed written consent, printed and read out in the local language (Hindi), as per GCP guidelines (www.fda.gov./oc/gcp) was obtained from every participant of the study. The study protocol was approved by a duly constituted human ethics committee prior to start of the study.\n\nHeight was measured with a calibrated height measuring scale to the nearest cm. Subjects were requested to stand upright without shoes with their back against the scale, heels together and eyes directed forward. Weight was measured with a digital balance (Camry®). The scale was checked every day and calibration was done with \"known\" weights. Subjects were asked to wear minimum clothing and weight was recorded to the nearest 0.5 kg. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using the formula: weight (kg)/height (m2). Waist was measured using a non-stretchable measuring tape without any clothing. Waist girth was measured at the midpoint point between the lowest point of the costal margin and the highest point of iliac crest in the midaxillary line at minimal respiration. Hip girth was measured as the greatest circumference at the level of greater trochanters with minimal thin clothing. Measurements were made to the nearest centimeter. Waist and hip ratio (WHR) was calculated by dividing the waist circumference (cm) with the hip circumference (cm). Blood pressure was recorded in the sitting position in the right arm to the nearest 1mm of Hg using a mercury sphygmomanometer, calibrated at least once a week. Two readings were taken at 5 minutes apart and the mean of the two was taken as the blood pressure. Fundus examination with dilated pupils by an ophthalmologist was done in all patients at the beginning of the study.\n\nDiabetes was diagnosed as per American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines, based either on the past medical records or present blood glucose values which showed unequivocal raised fasting blood glucose of more than \\> 116mg% and post-prandial or post-glucose values of \\> 200mg%. No case of IGT or IFG was included in the study. Current age was defined as the age at the time of examination (2006 - 2008). Duration of diabetes was taken as the difference between the current date and the date when the fasting or post-prandial blood sugar level met the ADA diabetes diagnostic criteria.\n\nThe study participants had direct consultation sessions with the study nutritionist, at the beginning of the study and at every monthly follow-up visits. A standard diet according to the ADA guidelines was advised, with 500-1000 kcal/day less (depending on the patient's starting weight and acceptance) than the individual patient's requirement. Special emphasis was placed on avoiding fried food, increasing intake of monounsaturated fats, low fat milk, fibers, vegetables and fruits. Fruits and milk are often avoided by our patients due to the misconception that fruits, except one apple a day, are harmful in diabetes and that milk is \"fattening\". The patients were also encouraged to take non-cereal diet consisting of low fat milk or yoghurt, fruits, vegetables and green salads, once a week. Each individual was given and explained a detailed individualized diet sheet (in the local language) first by the dietitian and then by the authors. They were asked to undertake some form of aerobic exercise, at least brisk walking (5 kilometers/hour) for 45 minutes daily, or at least 5 days a week. Where available and affordable, they were encouraged to join a health-club/gymnasium where they could do graded aerobic and resistance exercises under supervision. All patients were advised to quit tobacco use in any form. None of our study subjects were in the habit of taking alcohol regularly. Those, who took alcohol, never consumed more than 100ml of spirit per week. Nonnutritive sweeteners were allowed in moderation within the limits of recommendations of ADA. On each subsequent visit, the importance of diet and exercise were re-emphasized by the dietitian, paraclinical staff and the authors. Each case was interviewed in detail about the diet and exercise regimen they were following and corrections, if any, were suggested. Each patient was supplied with printed material in local language about diabetes in general and diet in particular. Drug treatment for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, wherever indicated, were not withheld during the study period.\n\nThe extended release metformin (XR), used in the present study was Bigsens XR® (Zydus CND), comprising a dual hydrophilic polymer matrix system. The starting dose of metformin (XR) was 0.5g twice daily after meal; the dose was gradually increased to the maximal tolerated dose. Those patients who were on some other anti-diabetic drug therapy; a 4 weeks washout period was given. All the subjects were informed that at the beginning of the study there was a possibility of initial increase in their blood glucose values, but the same would settle down as they adhere to our lifestyle protocol and as the dose of metformin is increased on subsequent visits. They were also informed about the possible passage of \"ghost tablet\" in their stool. Patients were told to withhold metformin for at least 5 days prior to any iodinated contrast radiographic study. Every patient was asked to perform urine dip stick test for acetone, at least every week and if found positive to contact this clinic immediately. They were also asked to report immediately in case of developing dyspnoea, marked vomiting, lethargy or fatigue.\n\nThe patients were followed-up at every month, and earlier if needed. Besides repeating the anthropometric measurements, blood glucose, urine examination, liver function tests (LFT) and serum lactate were measured. The Glycosylated haemoglobin (A1C) and serum lipids were estimated at every two month. At each follow-up visit the patients were questioned in detail about their diet and exercises, and deficiency, if any, were corrected. They were also questioned in detail about any side effects. Only those cases where we were satisfied about their diet and exercise adherence and regular intake of metformin were included in the outcome analysis. All patients possessed mobile phones. A message (SMS) was sent on their mobile phones every 15 days reinforcing the importance of diet and regular exercise. A SMS was also sent on their mobile phone if they were overdue on their appointment. In subjects in whom there was weight loss of more than 10% and A1C goal (≤6%) was achieved, the dose of metformin was reduced.\n\nHypertension was diagnosed based on past medical documentation, if they were on drug therapy for hypertension or if the subjects had systolic blood pressure of ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure of ≥90 mmHg. Hypertension (n=15) was treated with appropriate drugs, the first line of drug being ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker, or a combination of anti-hypertensive drugs, if required. Dyslipidemia was treated as per ADA guideline either by Atorvastatin or Fenofibrate or a combination thereof depending on the type of dyslipidemia. All patients more than 30 years of age, unless contraindicated, were given aspirin 150mg daily. No placebo group was included due to ethical considerations.\n\nAll investigations were carried out by SRL Ranbaxy Laboratories (www.srlranbaxy.com), Mumbai, which is accredited by the College of American Pathologist (CAP) and approved by NABL (National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories, Department of Science and Technology, India). The plasma glucose (Hexokinase method), serum creatinine (Jafees Reaction), serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (Urease-GLDH method) LFT and serum lactate were estimated on DADE RXL (Dade Behring Ltd, USA2007). Serum cholesterol, serum triglyceride, serum HDL cholesterol were measured by enzymatic method (Randox Imola, Randox Lab., UK, 2007). The A1C was estimated by HPLC method (Bio-Rad Variant II, Bio-Rad Labs, USA, 2007). Microalbuminuria and Albumin/Creatinine ratio were estimated from fasting spot urine sample by Immunoturbidimetry (Randox Imola). Serum Insulin and C-Peptide were estimated by Chemiluminescence technique (Advia Centaur, Bayer Health Care, USA, 2003).\n\nMS-Excel was used to enter and manage the data. The significance of change in various parameters of the study were tested by using paired t-test where the data was normally distributed, otherwise its non-parametric equivalent test, Wilcoxon paired signed-rank test was applied. Data are expressed as mean ± SD unless otherwise indicated. Values of P \\<0.05 was considered significant. All statistical calculations were performed using statistical software SPSS (version 12, SPSS, Chicago, Il, USA) and Stata (version 9.2, Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Obesity","Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus"],"keywords":["Type 2 diabetes","Obesity","Extended Release Metformin"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":102,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Extended Release Metformin","description":"0.5g twice a day to 2g twice a day for at least 12 months or more","otherNames":["Bigsens XR® (Zydus CND)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in Weight From Baseline at 12 Months or More","description":"Change: Weight after 12 months of therapy or more -
