== Running the application

To run the application, you must install the libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

[source,sh]
pip install -r requirements.txt

Then, create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file and include the following environment variables,
[source,sh]
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-proj-----"
OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-4"
NEO4J_URI = "neo4j+s://URI.databases.neo4j.io" #or "bolt://0.0.0.0:7687"
NEO4J_USERNAME = "neo4j"
NEO4J_PASSWORD = "password"

LANGCHAIN_API_KEY = ""
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2 ='true'
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT = "default"
LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT = "https://api.smith.langchain.com"


Then run the `streamlit run` command to start the app on link:http://localhost:8501/[http://localhost:8501/^].

[source,sh]
